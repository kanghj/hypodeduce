"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis(boolean,String)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.computeMillis(boolean, String)` supports hypothesis H1 because it computes the parsed datetime by setting saved fields, which includes verifying the validity of the day of the month. In the context of parsing ""2 29"" for a non-leap year, the method would attempt to set the day to 29, which is invalid for February in a non-leap year, leading to an `IllegalFieldValueException`. This indicates that the method does not account for leap year logic when parsing dates, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of leap year logic in the ""America/New_York"" timezone at the start of a non-leap year."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.saveField(DateTimeFieldType,int)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.saveField(DateTimeFieldType, int)` supports hypothesis H1 by saving the field value for the day of the month (29) and then attempting to apply it to the `MutableDateTime` object. In the context of the test, this method is called with `DateTimeFieldType.dayOfMonth()` and the value 29. Since the `MutableDateTime` is initialized to January 1, 2004, in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, which is a leap year, the method should correctly handle February 29. However, if the year were incorrectly set to a non-leap year, the method would fail to validate the day value, as seen in the error message indicating that 29 is out of range for February in a non-leap year. This suggests that the leap year logic might not be correctly applied when parsing the date, supporting H1."
org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.saveField(SavedField),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.saveField(SavedField)` is responsible for storing parsed date fields temporarily before they are applied to the `MutableDateTime` object. This method itself does not directly handle leap year logic; it merely saves the parsed fields. The failure occurs when the saved fields are applied, and the `dayOfMonth` value of 29 is validated against the year 2004, which is a leap year. However, the error suggests that the leap year logic might not be correctly applied when parsing into the `MutableDateTime` object, particularly in the ""America/New_York"" timezone context, which could affect how the date is interpreted at the start of the year."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.set(long,boolean)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",,"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.set(long, boolean)` supports Hypothesis H1 because it directly interacts with the field values during parsing, specifically setting the day of the month. In the test case, the method attempts to set the day to 29 in February 2004, which is a leap year. However, the error indicates that the method is not correctly handling the leap year logic, as it throws an `IllegalFieldValueException` stating that the day must be in the range [1,28]. This suggests that the method may not be correctly accounting for leap years when parsing dates in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.DateTimeParserBucket(long,Chronology,Locale,Integer,int)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.DateTimeParserBucket(long, Chronology, Locale, Integer, int)` initializes a parsing context with a specific instant, chronology, locale, pivot year, and default year. In the test `testParseInto_monthDay_feb29_newYork_startOfYear`, the `MutableDateTime` is initialized to January 1, 2004, which is a leap year. However, the error suggests that the parsing logic does not correctly handle February 29th when the year context is not explicitly set to a leap year, as the default year might not be correctly applied during parsing. This supports hypothesis H1, indicating a potential issue with leap year handling in the parsing logic, particularly when the year is inferred rather than explicitly set."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.sort(SavedField[],int)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.sort(SavedField[], int)` is primarily concerned with sorting `SavedField` objects and does not directly handle leap year logic or date validation. The failure in the test is due to the `IllegalFieldValueException` indicating that February 29th is not valid for the year 2004 in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, which is a leap year, suggesting a potential issue elsewhere in the parsing logic rather than in the sorting of fields. The sorting method's role is to ensure that fields are processed in the correct order, but it does not validate the correctness of the date values themselves, thus it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis about leap year handling."
org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.compareTo(SavedField),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",,"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket$SavedField.compareTo(SavedField)` is primarily concerned with ordering fields based on their duration, which does not directly relate to leap year logic or the parsing of specific dates like February 29th. The failure in the test is due to the `IllegalFieldValueException` indicating that February 29th is not valid in the year 2004 when parsed at the start of the year in the ""America/New_York"" timezone. This suggests that the issue is more likely related to the initial setup of the `MutableDateTime` object or the parsing logic itself, rather than the field comparison logic handled by `compareTo`. The method's focus on field ordering does not address the leap year validation, thus it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis directly."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.compareReverse(DurationField,DurationField)",0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing due to incorrect handling of leap year logic when parsing February 29th in the ""America/New_York"" timezone, especially at the start of a non-leap year.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeParserBucket.compareReverse(DurationField, DurationField)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is primarily concerned with comparing `DurationField` objects rather than handling date parsing logic or leap year calculations. The failure in the test is due to the `IllegalFieldValueException` indicating that February 29th is being parsed in a non-leap year context, which is unrelated to the reverse comparison of duration fields. The issue is more likely related to the logic in `DateTimeFormatter` or `MutableDateTime` that incorrectly handles leap year validation for the given date and timezone."
