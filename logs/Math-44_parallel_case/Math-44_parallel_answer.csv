org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.evaluateStep(StepInterpolator),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.evaluateStep(StepInterpolator)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to precision errors in event detection. The method evaluates whether an event occurs within a proposed step using a `StepInterpolator`, which involves numerical computations that can be sensitive to precision issues. In the failure context, the assertion failure ""going backward in time"" suggests that the event detection algorithm might inaccurately determine the timing of events due to precision errors, causing incorrect event handling or missed events. The method's reliance on precise calculations to determine event occurrences aligns with the hypothesis that precision errors could lead to the observed failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.EventState(EventHandler,double,double,int,UnivariateRealSolver)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.EventState(EventHandler,double,double,int,UnivariateRealSolver)` initializes the event state with specific accuracy parameters and a solver, which are crucial for detecting events accurately. In the failure context, the event handler is added with a precision of `1.0e-9`, which is very tight and could lead to precision errors if the solver or the event detection algorithm cannot handle such small tolerances effectively. The failure message ""going backward in time"" suggests that the event detection might have inaccurately identified the event time due to precision issues, supporting Hypothesis H1."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.getEventTime(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.getEventTime()` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to precision errors in event detection. If the method inaccurately calculates or returns the event time due to floating-point precision issues, it could lead to incorrect event handling, such as detecting an event at an incorrect time or missing it entirely. In the failure context, the assertion failure indicates a backward time step (7.796578226186635 < 10.99), suggesting that the event time calculation might have been imprecise, causing the integrator to handle events incorrectly."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.reinitializeBegin(StepInterpolator),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.reinitializeBegin(StepInterpolator)` supports Hypothesis H1 by addressing potential precision errors in event detection. By evaluating the event handler's switching function at the previous time and perturbing the time slightly if the function is exactly zero, it aims to prevent false event detection at the start of a step. This behavior suggests that precision issues could indeed lead to incorrect event handling, as the method explicitly attempts to mitigate such errors by adjusting the time to avoid detecting non-existent events."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.reset(double,double[])",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.reset(double, double[])` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to precision errors in event detection. The method checks if the absolute difference between the `pendingEventTime` and the current time `t` is within a specified `convergence` threshold. If this condition is not met, the method returns `false`, indicating no reset is needed. This precision check could lead to incorrect event handling if the threshold is too tight or if floating-point inaccuracies cause the condition to fail, resulting in missed or improperly handled events, as suggested by the failure context where time appears to regress unexpectedly."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.stepAccepted(double,double[])",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `stepAccepted(double t, double[] y)` updates the internal state by setting `t0` to the current time `t` and recalculating `g0` using the event handler's function `g(t, y)`. This method supports Hypothesis H1 because it relies on precise calculations of `t` and `g(t, y)` to determine if an event has occurred. If there is a precision error in calculating `t` or `g(t, y)`, it could lead to incorrect event handling, such as missing an event or incorrectly acknowledging an event, which aligns with the failure context where the test reports ""going backward in time"" due to incorrect event detection."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.stop(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventStateTest::testIssue695"" may be caused by a precision error in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect event handling or missed events.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.events.EventState.stop()` determines whether the integration process should halt based on the last event action, without directly addressing precision errors in event detection. Since it does not involve calculations or adjustments related to event timing or precision, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in `testIssue695` suggests a backward time step, which is more likely related to precision issues in event detection rather than the stopping logic itself."
