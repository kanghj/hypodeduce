"org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.SubLine.intersection(SubLine,boolean)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure might be caused by a precision error in floating-point arithmetic when calculating the intersection point of two lines in three-dimensional space.,org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.threed.SubLine (HH1),"The method `SubLine.intersection(SubLine, boolean)` computes the intersection point of two infinite lines and then checks if this point lies within the bounds of both sub-lines. The failure context indicates a `NullPointerException` at `Line.getAbscissa(Line.java:114)`, suggesting that the intersection calculation might not be returning a valid point, potentially due to precision errors in floating-point arithmetic. Since the method relies on precise calculations to determine if the intersection point lies within the sub-line ranges, any small precision error could lead to incorrect results or null values, supporting hypothesis H1."
"org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.intersection(SubLine,boolean)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure might be caused by a precision error in floating-point arithmetic when calculating the intersection point of two lines in three-dimensional space.,org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.intersection(SubLine, boolean)` computes the intersection point of two sub-lines by first determining the intersection point of their underlying infinite lines. This process involves floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce precision errors, especially when the lines are nearly parallel or the intersection point is at a large distance from the origin. The method then checks if the computed intersection point lies within the bounds of both sub-lines, which could further exacerbate precision issues if the point is near the endpoints. Given that the test case involves non-intersecting sub-lines, the precision error hypothesis (H1) is plausible, as small inaccuracies in floating-point calculations might lead to unexpected results, such as a `NullPointerException` when handling edge cases."
"org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.SubLine(Vector2D,Vector2D)",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the sublines are parallel but not collinear, leading to a false assumption of intersection.",org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.SubLine(Vector2D, Vector2D)` constructs a `SubLine` by creating a `Line` and an `IntervalsSet` for the segment. This supports Hypothesis H2 because if the `buildIntervalSet(Vector2D, Vector2D)` method does not correctly handle cases where the endpoints define parallel but non-collinear lines, it might incorrectly assume an intersection. In the test case, `sub1` and `sub2` are parallel but not collinear, and if the interval set construction does not account for this, it could lead to a false assumption of intersection, causing the `NullPointerException` when attempting to compute the intersection."
"org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.buildIntervalSet(Vector2D,Vector2D)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure might be caused by a precision error in floating-point arithmetic when calculating the intersection point of two lines in three-dimensional space.,org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.geometry.euclidean.twod.SubLine.buildIntervalSet(Vector2D, Vector2D)` constructs an `IntervalsSet` by projecting two points onto a sub-space, which is a two-dimensional operation. This method does not directly involve three-dimensional calculations or floating-point arithmetic for intersection points in three-dimensional space. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it operates in a different dimensional context and does not interact with the three-dimensional intersection logic where the precision error might occur."
