org.joda.time.Period.normalizedStandard(PeriodType),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.normalizedStandard(PeriodType)` does not directly handle leap years; it normalizes periods based on fixed assumptions of time units (e.g., 12 months per year, 7 days per week). The failure is due to the `PeriodType.months()` not supporting fields like years, which leads to an `UnsupportedOperationException` when the method attempts to manipulate these unsupported fields. This indicates that the failure is not related to leap year handling but rather to the method's inability to process unsupported fields within the specified `PeriodType`."
org.joda.time.Period.withYears(int),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.withYears(int)` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1 regarding leap year handling because it focuses solely on modifying the years component of a period. The failure occurs due to an `UnsupportedOperationException` when attempting to set a field not supported by the `PeriodType.months()`, which does not include years. This indicates that the issue is more about the incompatibility of the period type with the operation rather than leap year calculations. The method's behavior of throwing an exception when a field is unsupported aligns with the error encountered, suggesting the problem lies in the period type's field support rather than leap year handling."
org.joda.time.Period.Period(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.Period()` constructs a new period with all fields initialized to zero, which means it does not directly handle or calculate any values related to leap years or months. The failure in the test is more likely related to the `normalizedStandard` method, which attempts to convert the period into a standard form based on the specified `PeriodType`. Since the `PeriodType.months()` does not support years or days, the error arises from trying to normalize a period with unsupported fields, rather than an issue with leap year calculations."
"org.joda.time.Period.Period(int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.Period(int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int)` constructs a period using the standard set of fields, which includes years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It does not directly handle leap years or any specific calendar calculations, as it simply initializes the period with the given values. The failure in the test is more likely related to the `normalizedStandard` method's handling of unsupported fields in the `PeriodType.months()`, as indicated by the `UnsupportedOperationException`, rather than an issue with leap year calculations."
"org.joda.time.Period.Period(long,PeriodType,Chronology)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.Period(long, PeriodType, Chronology)` constructs a period based on a millisecond duration, period type, and chronology, without directly handling leap years or month-to-day conversions. It relies on the superclass constructor to interpret the duration according to the specified period type and chronology. Since the failure occurs during the `normalizedStandard` method call, which attempts to normalize the period to a standard form, the issue is more likely related to the `PeriodType.months()` not supporting certain fields (like years) rather than leap year handling, as the constructor itself does not perform such calculations."
org.joda.time.Period.getMonths(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.getMonths()` simply retrieves the number of months in the period without performing any calculations related to days or leap years. It delegates to `getPeriodType().getIndexedField` using the `MONTH_INDEX`, which means it only accesses the stored value for months. This behavior neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as the method does not engage in any operations that would involve handling leap years or converting months to days. The failure is more likely related to the `normalizedStandard` method's handling of unsupported fields in the `PeriodType.months()`, as indicated by the stack trace."
org.joda.time.Period.getYears(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.getYears()` retrieves the number of years in the period by calling `getPeriodType().getIndexedField` with the `YEAR_INDEX`. This method does not directly handle leap years or any specific calculations related to days, as it simply returns the stored year value. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as the failure is more likely related to how the `normalizedStandard` method processes months and days, rather than how years are retrieved or stored. The error occurs in `Period.normalizedStandard`, which suggests the issue lies in the handling of months and their conversion, not in the retrieval of years."
org.joda.time.Period.getDays(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.getDays()` retrieves the number of days in the period by calling `getPeriodType().getIndexedField` with the `DAY_INDEX`. This method does not directly handle leap years or month-to-day conversions, as it simply returns the stored value for days. The failure in `normalizedStandard` is more likely due to the `PeriodType.months()` not supporting day fields, as indicated by the `UnsupportedOperationException`, rather than an issue with leap year handling."
org.joda.time.Period.getHours(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.getHours()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it deals specifically with retrieving the number of hours in a period, unrelated to the handling of months or leap years. The failure in the test is related to the `normalizedStandard` method, which attempts to normalize a period using `PeriodType.months()`, and the error occurs due to unsupported fields rather than incorrect leap year handling. The call flow involving `getHours()` does not interact with month or day calculations, thus it is not relevant to the hypothesis concerning leap year handling."
org.joda.time.Period.getMillis(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of leap years when normalizing periods that include months, leading to an unexpected calculation of days.",org.joda.time.Period (HH2),"The method `org.joda.time.Period.getMillis()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it focuses on retrieving the millisecond component of a period rather than handling month or day calculations. The failure in the test is related to the `normalizedStandard` method, which attempts to convert the period into a standard form based on the specified `PeriodType`. The error occurs because `PeriodType.months()` does not support fields like years or days, leading to an `UnsupportedOperationException` when the method tries to adjust the period's months without considering leap years. The `getMillis()` method is not involved in this process, as it deals with milliseconds, not month-to-day conversions."
