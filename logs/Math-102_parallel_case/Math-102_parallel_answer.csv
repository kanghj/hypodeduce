"org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquareTest(double[],long[])",0.810000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision in the calculation of the chi-square statistic for large datasets.,org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl.chiSquareTest(double[], long[])` rescales the `expected` array to ensure that the sum of the expected and observed counts are equal, which could introduce floating-point precision issues, especially with large datasets. In the failure context, the discrepancy between the expected and actual chi-square test statistic values suggests that the rescaling process might be causing significant precision errors, supporting hypothesis H1. The large difference between the expected value `<114875.90421929007>` and the actual value `<3624883.3429077636>` indicates potential precision loss during computation."

"org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.TestUtils.chiSquareTest(double[],long[])",0.806842,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision in the calculation of the chi-square statistic for large datasets.,org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.TestUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.TestUtils.chiSquareTest(double[], long[])` directly delegates the computation to the `chiSquareTest` method of the `ChiSquareTestImpl` instance, using the provided `exp` and `obs` arrays. The discrepancy between the expected and actual chi-square test statistic values (114875.90421929007 vs. 3624883.3429077636) suggests that the method may not handle floating-point precision adequately for large datasets, as the large magnitude of the input values could exacerbate precision errors during the calculation. This supports Hypothesis H1, indicating that floating-point precision issues might be causing the failure."

The failure context shows a significant discrepancy between the expected and actual chi-square statistic values for large datasets, suggesting potential issues with floating-point precision. Given the large magnitude of the input values in both `exp` and `obs`, the method's reliance on floating-point arithmetic could lead to precision errors, supporting hypothesis H1."
