Hypotheses:
  H1 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H1: The test "pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit" might be failing due to an unintended transitive dependency on JUnit introduced by a recently added or updated library in the project's dependency tree.
  H2 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H2: The test "pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit" might be failing due to an inadvertent inclusion of JUnit-related classes or methods in the Mockito library's dependencies or build configuration.
  H3 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H3: The test "pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit" might be failing due to an inadvertent inclusion of JUnit-related classes or methods in the Mockito library's classpath or dependencies.
  H4 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H4: The test "pure_mockito_should_not_depend_JUnit" might be failing due to an indirect dependency on JUnit introduced by a recently added or updated third-party library.
  H5 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H5: The test failure might be caused by an unintended transitive dependency on JUnit introduced by a recently added or updated third-party library.
