"org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.appendFixedWidthPadRight(Object,int,char)",0.900000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderAppendInsertTest::testLang299"" could be caused by a regression in the StrBuilder's append or insert methods, leading to incorrect handling of null or special character inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder (HH1),"The method `appendFixedWidthPadRight` is designed to append an object's string representation to the `StrBuilder`, padding it on the right to a specified fixed width. In the test case `testLang299`, the method is called with the string ""foo"", a width of 1, and a padding character '-'. The failure occurs because the method attempts to copy more characters than the available space, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This suggests that the method does not correctly handle cases where the specified width is less than the length of the object's string representation, which contradicts hypothesis H1, as the issue is not related to handling null or special character inputs but rather to incorrect handling of width constraints."
org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.ensureCapacity(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderAppendInsertTest::testLang299"" could be caused by a regression in the StrBuilder's append or insert methods, leading to incorrect handling of null or special character inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.ensureCapacity(int)` is designed to ensure that the internal buffer has sufficient capacity to accommodate new data. In the context of the failure, the method supports hypothesis H1 because if the buffer capacity is not correctly ensured before appending or inserting, it could lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to copy characters into an insufficiently sized buffer. However, the method itself does not directly handle null or special character inputs, so while it may contribute to the failure by not expanding the buffer as needed, it does not directly address the handling of such inputs."
org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilder(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilderAppendInsertTest::testLang299"" could be caused by a regression in the StrBuilder's append or insert methods, leading to incorrect handling of null or special character inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.StrBuilder.StrBuilder(int)` initializes a `StrBuilder` with a specified capacity, defaulting to a constant if the capacity is zero or negative. In the test `testLang299`, a `StrBuilder` is created with an initial capacity of 1, which is valid and does not trigger the default capacity. The failure occurs during the `appendFixedWidthPadRight` method call, suggesting that the issue is not with the constructor itself but potentially with how the append method handles capacity or padding logic, rather than a regression in handling null or special characters."
