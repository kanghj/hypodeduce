org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.getSumSquaredErrors(),0.900000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""testSSENonNegative"" might be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision errors during the calculation of the sum of squared errors (SSE), leading to negative values.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression (HH4),"The method `getSumSquaredErrors()` calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) using the formula `sumYY - (sumXY * sumXY / sumXX)`. This calculation involves multiple floating-point operations, which are susceptible to precision errors, especially when the values of `sumXY` and `sumXX` are very close, potentially leading to a negative result due to precision loss. Given the test data, if `sumXY * sumXY` is nearly equal to `sumYY * sumXX`, small floating-point inaccuracies could cause the subtraction to yield a negative SSE, supporting Hypothesis H4."
"org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.addData(double,double)",0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases in the input data, such as zero or negative values, leading to unexpected behavior in the sum of squared errors calculation.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression (HH4),"The method `addData(double x, double y)` updates the regression data set by recalculating means and sums of squares using the differences `dx` and `dy` between the new data point and the current means `xbar` and `ybar`. This approach does not inherently handle edge cases like zero or negative values differently, suggesting that if such values are present, they could lead to unexpected behavior in the sum of squared errors calculation. Since the method does not include specific checks or adjustments for these edge cases, it supports hypothesis H2 that incorrect handling of such inputs might cause the failure."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.SimpleRegression(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testSSENonNegative"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the sum of squared errors (SSE) calculation, potentially allowing negative values due to floating-point precision errors or incorrect data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression.SimpleRegression()` constructs an empty `SimpleRegression` instance and does not perform any calculations or data handling itself. It initializes the object without adding any data, meaning it does not directly contribute to the calculation of the sum of squared errors (SSE). Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any operations related to SSE calculation or floating-point precision that could lead to negative values. The issue likely arises from subsequent data handling or calculation methods within the `SimpleRegression` class."
