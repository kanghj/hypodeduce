org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.ISO8859_1_ESCAPE(),0.310000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArraysTest::testISO8859_1_ESCAPE"" may be due to incorrect or outdated mappings in the ISO-8859-1 escape sequences within the EntityArrays class.",org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.ISO8859_1_ESCAPE()` returns a clone of the internal `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array, ensuring that the original data remains unmodified by external operations. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure in the test could be due to incorrect or outdated mappings within the `ISO8859_1_ESCAPE` array itself, rather than modifications from external sources. The test failure indicates duplicate entries, suggesting that the issue lies within the data provided by the method, which aligns with the hypothesis that the mappings may be incorrect or outdated."
org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.invert(String[][]),0.308632,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArraysTest::testISO8859_1_ESCAPE"" could be due to an incorrect or outdated mapping of ISO-8859-1 character entities within the EntityArrays class, leading to unexpected translation results.",org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays.invert(String[][])` inverts a given escape array, swapping each pair of strings, which is crucial for ensuring that both escape and unescape mappings are correct and consistent. If the original escape array used in `EntityArrays.ISO8859_1_ESCAPE()` contains duplicates or incorrect mappings, the inversion process could propagate these issues, leading to unexpected results when translating characters. This supports Hypothesis H2, as an incorrect or outdated mapping in the original array could cause the test failure by producing duplicate entries or incorrect translations in the inverted array."
