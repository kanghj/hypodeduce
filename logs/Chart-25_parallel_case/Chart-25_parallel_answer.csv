If the method does not include checks for null mean values, it could lead to a null pointer exception when attempting to access or use the mean value, which supports hypothesis H1. The failure in the test `testDrawWithNullMeanVertical` suggests that the method may not handle null mean values properly, as the test is designed to ensure no exceptions occur when a null mean is present. If the method lacks null checks or default handling for null means, it would directly contribute to the observed test failure."

The failure in the test `testDrawWithNullMeanVertical` suggests that the renderer might not be handling null mean values properly, as the test is designed to ensure no exceptions occur when a null mean is present. If the method lacks null checks or appropriate handling logic for null values, it would align with the hypothesis that the renderer's handling of null means is flawed."

Since it does not interact with or process dataset values, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in handling null mean values likely occurs elsewhere in the rendering logic, not within this constructor, as it does not involve any logic related to data handling or rendering."
