org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.invocationListeners(InvocationListener[]),0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.invocationListeners(InvocationListener[])` supports hypothesis H1. The method adds listeners to an internal list and returns the `MockSettingsImpl` instance for chaining, but it does not inherently manage the preservation of these listeners across mock resets. In the test code, after setting the listener with `withSettings().invocationListeners(invocationListener)`, the `reset(mockedList)` call likely clears the internal state of the mock, including the registered listeners, leading to the failure where `invocationListener.reportInvocation(any(MethodInvocationReport.class))` is not invoked."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getInvocationListeners(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getInvocationListeners()` supports hypothesis H1. It returns the list of `InvocationListener` instances associated with the `MockSettingsImpl`. If the `reset(mockedList)` operation does not preserve the state of `invocationListeners`, the listeners would be lost, leading to the failure where `invocationListener.reportInvocation(any(MethodInvocationReport.class))` is not invoked. This aligns with the observed behavior where there are zero interactions with the mock after the reset."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.defaultAnswer(Answer),0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a race condition where the listener is not properly reattached to the mock object after a reset operation, leading to inconsistent test outcomes.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.defaultAnswer(Answer)` sets the default behavior for a mock when a method is invoked but does not directly manage invocation listeners. This method supports hypothesis H2 indirectly by highlighting that the reset operation might not reapply all configurations, such as invocation listeners, since `defaultAnswer` focuses on method behavior rather than listener attachment. The failure context suggests that after `reset(mockedList)`, the listener is not reattached, leading to the absence of interactions, which aligns with the hypothesis of inconsistent outcomes due to improper listener reattachment."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getSpiedInstance(),0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a race condition where the listener is not properly reattached to the mock object after a reset operation, leading to inconsistent test outcomes.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getSpiedInstance()` returns the instance being spied on, which is unrelated to the hypothesis H2 concerning a race condition with invocation listeners. The failure context involves a mock, not a spy, and the issue arises from resetting the mock, which clears invocation listeners. Since `getSpiedInstance()` pertains to spies and not the reattachment of listeners after a reset, it neither supports nor contradicts H2 directly."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.initiateMockName(Class),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.initiateMockName(Class)` initializes the `mockName` field with a new `MockName` instance, which is unrelated to listener management. This method focuses on naming the mock rather than handling listeners. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve the preservation or loss of listener state during a reset operation. The failure is more likely related to how the `reset()` method affects listener registration, which is not addressed by `initiateMockName`."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getDefaultAnswer(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getDefaultAnswer()` returns the default `Answer` configured for a mock, which is unrelated to the preservation of invocation listeners during a reset operation. The failure context indicates that the mock's listeners are lost after calling `reset(mockedList)`, which suggests that the reset operation itself is responsible for clearing the listeners, not the default answer configuration. Therefore, the method does not support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not pertain to listener management or retention during reset operations."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getExtraInterfaces(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getExtraInterfaces()` returns the array of extra interfaces that a mock should implement, which does not directly relate to the preservation of invocation listeners during a reset operation. The failure context indicates that the mock's invocation listeners are lost after calling `reset(mockedList)`, suggesting that the reset operation does not preserve listener state. Since `getExtraInterfaces()` deals with interface implementation rather than listener management, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getMockName(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getMockName()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is concerned with retrieving the mock's name rather than managing or preserving listener state. The failure described in the test is related to the loss of invocation listeners after a reset operation, which is not addressed by the `getMockName()` method. The method's role is to provide the mock's name, which does not influence the preservation of listeners during a reset."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.isSerializable(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the mock object losing its registered listeners due to an improper reset operation that does not preserve listener state.,org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.isSerializable()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1. This method determines whether a mock is configured to be serializable, which is unrelated to the preservation of invocation listeners during a reset operation. The failure described in the test code is about losing listeners after a reset, which is not influenced by the mock's serializability setting. The issue likely lies in how the `reset()` method handles listener state, rather than the serializability configuration."
