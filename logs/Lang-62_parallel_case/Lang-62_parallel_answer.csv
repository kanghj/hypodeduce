org.apache.commons.lang.Entities.unescape(String),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow"" may be failing due to an integer overflow occurring when handling large numeric entity values, leading to incorrect parsing or encoding results.",org.apache.commons.lang.Entities (HH3),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.Entities.unescape(String)` is likely contributing to the failure of the test `org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow` due to an integer overflow. The test case expects the string ""&#12345678;"" to remain unchanged, but the method appears to incorrectly parse this large numeric entity, resulting in the character ""慎"". This suggests that the method may be attempting to convert the numeric entity to a character code, and due to the large value, it overflows, leading to an incorrect character being returned. The presence of the character ""慎"" instead of the expected string indicates that the method does not handle large numeric entities correctly, supporting hypothesis H1."
"org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.put(int,Object)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow"" may be failing due to an integer overflow occurring when handling large numeric entity values, leading to incorrect parsing or encoding results.",org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.put(int,Object)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it primarily deals with inserting or updating key-value pairs in a hash map rather than parsing or encoding numeric entity values. The failure in the test `testNumberOverflow` suggests an issue with handling large numeric entity values, but the `put` method's role is limited to managing entries in a map, and it does not inherently involve operations that would cause integer overflow during parsing. Therefore, the method's functionality of managing hash map entries does not directly contribute to or contradict the hypothesis of integer overflow in numeric entity handling."
org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.IntHashMap(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow"" may be failing due to an integer overflow occurring when handling large numeric entity values, leading to incorrect parsing or encoding results.",org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.IntHashMap()` initializes an `IntHashMap` with a default capacity and load factor, which does not directly handle or parse numeric entity values. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it is unrelated to the parsing or encoding of numeric entities. The failure in `testNumberOverflow` is more likely due to the handling of large numeric values elsewhere in the code, not the initialization of the `IntHashMap`."
"org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.IntHashMap(int,float)",0.200000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow"" may be failing due to an incorrect handling of integer overflow when converting large numeric character references to their corresponding characters.",org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.IntHashMap(int, float)` initializes an internal data structure with specified capacity and load factor, focusing on argument validation and setup. It does not directly handle numeric character references or conversions, nor does it interact with the logic that processes character entities. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H5, as it is unrelated to the handling of numeric character references or potential integer overflow issues in the test."
org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.rehash(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang.EntitiesTest::testNumberOverflow"" may be failing due to an integer overflow occurring when handling large numeric entity values, leading to incorrect parsing or encoding results.",org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.IntHashMap.rehash()` is primarily concerned with resizing and redistributing entries within the hash map to maintain performance as the map grows. It does not directly handle numeric entity values or parsing operations related to the test failure. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the test failure is related to the handling of large numeric entity values, which is outside the scope of the rehashing process. The rehash method's focus on internal data structure management does not involve operations that would lead to integer overflow in the context of parsing or encoding numeric entities."
