"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int,int)",0.900000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testGcd"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) algorithm that does not handle edge cases such as zero or negative inputs properly.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int, int)` supports hypothesis H1 as it appears to incorrectly handle edge cases involving zero inputs. The test case `assertEquals(0, MathUtils.gcd(0, 0))` expects the GCD of zero and zero to be zero, but the method returns the sum of the absolute values, which is incorrect. Additionally, the method's handling of negative inputs is not explicitly shown in the provided snippet, but the test failures suggest that the implementation may not correctly compute the GCD when negative numbers are involved, as evidenced by the unexpected result in the stack trace."
