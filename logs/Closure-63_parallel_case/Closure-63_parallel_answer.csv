"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.format(JSError,boolean)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of lines, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.format(JSError, boolean)` constructs an error message string that includes a source excerpt with a caret pointing to the error character. If the method incorrectly handles trailing spaces, it could lead to formatting discrepancies, such as the unexpected absence of a space before the caret in the test output. The test `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1` expects a space before the caret, suggesting that a recent change in how trailing spaces are managed in the `format` method might be causing the test to fail by omitting this space."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter$LineNumberingFormatter.formatLine(String,int)",0.808632,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of whitespace characters at the end of a line in the error message formatting logic.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter$LineNumberingFormatter.formatLine(String, int)` supports hypothesis H2 because it returns the input line string unchanged, which means it does not handle or modify whitespace characters at the end of a line. Since the method does not process or alter the whitespace, any issues related to whitespace handling in the error message formatting logic would not be addressed by this method, potentially leading to the observed test failures."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider),0.806842,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of whitespace characters at the end of a line in the error message formatting logic.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider)` initializes the formatter with a `SourceExcerptProvider` and defaults the excerpt type to `LINE`. This setup suggests that the formatter is designed to handle line-based excerpts, which might not account for specific whitespace handling at the end of lines. The failure in the test could be due to this default behavior not properly managing trailing whitespace, as the excerpt type does not explicitly address whitespace handling, supporting hypothesis H2."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.formatError(JSError),0.700000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of lines, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.formatError(JSError)` calls the private `format(JSError, boolean)` method with the `warning` flag set to `false`, which suggests that the formatting logic is centralized in the private method. Since the test failure involves unexpected formatting results, it is plausible that a recent change in the `format(JSError, boolean)` method could have introduced an issue with handling trailing spaces, supporting hypothesis H5. The test output indicates a discrepancy in the expected and actual formatted error message, specifically related to the placement of the caret (`^`), which could be affected by how trailing spaces are processed."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider,SourceExcerpt)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of whitespace characters at the end of a line in the error message formatting logic, leading to unexpected output.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider, SourceExcerpt)` initializes the formatter with a source and excerpt but does not directly handle or manipulate whitespace characters in error messages. Since it primarily sets up the formatter's context without processing the error message content, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4 directly. The issue with whitespace handling likely occurs in a different part of the error formatting logic, as this constructor does not engage with the formatting process itself."
