"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int,int)",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testGcd"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) algorithm that does not handle negative integers properly.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.gcd(int, int)` supports Hypothesis H1 because it calculates the GCD using the absolute values of the input integers. This approach should correctly handle negative integers, as the method converts them to positive before proceeding with the GCD calculation. The test failures in `testGcd` related to negative integers (e.g., `MathUtils.gcd(-a, b)`) suggest that the method should handle these cases correctly, contradicting the hypothesis that negative integers are not handled properly. The failure might instead be due to another issue, such as an unexpected exception handling or a different edge case not covered by the hypothesis."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.lcm(int,int)",0.200000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testGcd"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) algorithm that does not handle negative integers properly.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.lcm(int,int)` supports hypothesis H1 because it relies on the `gcd(a, b)` function to compute the least common multiple. If the `gcd` method does not handle negative integers properly, it could lead to incorrect results in the `lcm` calculation, particularly when negative values are involved. For example, if `gcd(-a, b)` is incorrect, then `lcm(-a, b)` would also be incorrect, as the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a / gcd(a, b)) * b` depends on the correct computation of `gcd(a, b)`."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int,int)",0.200000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testGcd"" could be due to an overflow error when computing the greatest common divisor for large integer inputs.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.mulAndCheck(int,int)` supports Hypothesis H3 by demonstrating a mechanism for detecting overflow errors during multiplication, which is relevant to the failure in `testGcd`. The method multiplies two integers and checks if the result exceeds the bounds of an integer, throwing an `ArithmeticException` if it does. This behavior aligns with the failure context in `testGcd`, where an `ArithmeticException` is expected, suggesting that similar overflow checks might be necessary or are already in place for GCD calculations involving large integers."
