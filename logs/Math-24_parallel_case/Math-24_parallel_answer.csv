The failure in `testMath855` could be due to precision errors in `doOptimize()` when handling edge cases with very small input values, such as the `offset` and `delta` used in the test. These small values might lead to numerical instability or insufficient precision in the algorithm's calculations, causing it to return a suboptimal point. The method's reliance on floating-point arithmetic for determining the best point could exacerbate this issue, supporting hypothesis H1."

If these thresholds are not set appropriately, they could lead to premature termination, supporting Hypothesis H2. The method's role in setting up the convergence criteria directly influences how edge cases are handled, and incorrect parameter values or a poorly defined `ConvergenceChecker` could result in the optimizer failing to report the best point, as seen in the test failure."

The failure in `testMath855` might occur if the optimizer's precision settings are inadequate for handling the small offsets and deltas used in the test, causing it to not report the best point accurately."
