"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence,char[])",0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence, char[])` checks if a given `CharSequence` contains any character from a specified array of characters. The test failure suggests that the method may not correctly handle surrogate pairs, as it returned `true` when checking if `CharUSuppCharLow` contains any characters from `CharU20001.toCharArray()`, which was expected to be `false`. This indicates that the method might be improperly detecting supplementary characters, potentially due to not correctly processing surrogate pairs, which are used to represent characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane in UTF-16 encoding."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsAny(CharSequence, String)` converts the `searchChars` string into a character array and checks if any of these characters are present in the input `CharSequence`. This approach may not correctly handle surrogate pairs, as it treats each character individually rather than recognizing pairs that form supplementary characters. In the test case, the failure occurs when a low surrogate character (`CharUSuppCharLow`) is incorrectly detected as containing a supplementary character (`CharU20001`), supporting the hypothesis that the method does not properly handle surrogate pairs."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence,char[])",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, char[])` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially mishandling surrogate pairs, as it searches for individual characters rather than recognizing pairs as a single supplementary character. In the test case, `CharUSuppCharLow.indexOf(CharU20001)` returns `-1`, indicating that the method may not correctly identify the supplementary character `CharU20001` when split into high and low surrogates. This behavior aligns with the test failure, where `containsAny` unexpectedly returns `true`, suggesting improper handling of surrogate pairs."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence, String)` checks if a CharSequence does not contain any characters from a given set. If either the CharSequence or the invalid character array is null, it returns true. This behavior suggests that the method does not specifically handle surrogate pairs, as it treats null inputs as non-existent characters, which aligns with the hypothesis H1. The test failure in `containsAny` could be due to improper handling of surrogate pairs, as the method might incorrectly detect supplementary characters, leading to unexpected true results when checking for their presence."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence,char[])",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.containsNone(CharSequence, char[])` checks if a CharSequence does not contain any characters from a given array. It returns `true` if either the CharSequence or the character array is `null`, or if the CharSequence is empty. The test failure in `containsAny` suggests that the method may not correctly handle surrogate pairs, as it incorrectly detects supplementary characters. Since `containsNone` relies on similar logic to `containsAny` for character detection, it supports the hypothesis that improper handling of surrogate pairs could lead to incorrect results, as evidenced by the failure when `CharUSuppCharLow` is checked against `CharU20001.toCharArray()`."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(CharSequence,char[])",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(CharSequence, char[])` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially mishandling surrogate pairs, as it operates on `char` arrays without explicit handling for surrogate pairs, which are represented by two `char` values. In the test failure context, the method `containsAny` might incorrectly detect supplementary characters due to similar handling, as it likely relies on `indexOfAnyBut` or similar logic that does not account for the two-part nature of surrogate pairs. This could lead to incorrect results when checking for the presence of supplementary characters, as seen in the test case where a broken surrogate pair is involved."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence,String)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAny(CharSequence, String)` supports hypothesis H1 as it searches for the first index of any character from a given set within a CharSequence. If the method does not correctly handle surrogate pairs, it could misinterpret the boundaries of supplementary characters, leading to incorrect index detection. In the test failure context, the `containsAny` method might rely on `indexOfAny` to determine character presence, and if `indexOfAny` fails to correctly process surrogate pairs, it could cause `containsAny` to incorrectly return `true` when it should return `false`, as seen in the failed assertion."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(String,String)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.indexOfAnyBut(String,String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially mishandling surrogate pairs, similar to the `containsAny` method. If the input string contains broken surrogate pairs (e.g., `CharUSuppCharHigh` or `CharUSuppCharLow`), the method may incorrectly identify characters due to its character-by-character iteration approach, which does not account for the pairing of high and low surrogates. This behavior aligns with the test failure where `containsAny` incorrectly detected supplementary characters, suggesting both methods might share similar issues with surrogate pair handling."
org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by incorrect handling of surrogate pairs in the `containsAny` method, leading to improper detection of supplementary characters in the input string.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isEmpty(CharSequence)` checks if a given CharSequence is null or empty, which does not directly handle or process surrogate pairs or supplementary characters. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any logic related to the detection or handling of surrogate pairs. The test failure in `containsAny` likely stems from how surrogate pairs are processed, which is unrelated to the null or empty checks performed by `isEmpty`."
