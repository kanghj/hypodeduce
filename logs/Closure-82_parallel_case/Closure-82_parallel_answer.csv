"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyAccess(JSType,String,NodeTraversal,Node)",0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `checkPropertyAccess` ensures that a property access is valid by dereferencing the `JSType` and checking if the `ObjectType` supports the accessed property. In the context of the failure, the method likely checks if `String.prototype.toLowerCase` has an `indexOf` property, which it does not. This supports hypothesis H3, as a recent change in the type inference algorithm might incorrectly infer `toLowerCase` as having an `indexOf` method, leading to the unexpected type mismatch observed in the test failure. The method's role in validating property access aligns with the hypothesis that type inference changes could cause such mismatches."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` processes different types of parse tree nodes using a switch statement, which suggests that it plays a crucial role in type checking by determining how each node type should be handled. If a recent change in the type inference logic affected how specific node types are processed, it could lead to incorrect type annotations, supporting Hypothesis H1. The failure in `testIssue301` might be due to a misinterpretation of the `indexOf` method on `String.prototype.toLowerCase`, which could be an edge case not correctly handled by the updated logic in the `visit` method."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitGetProp(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitGetProp(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` processes GETPROP nodes, which are related to property access in JavaScript code. In the context of the failure, the method's role in handling property access could be crucial, as the error involves a property (`indexOf`) that is incorrectly assumed to exist on the result of `String.prototype.toLowerCase`. If recent changes in type inference logic affect how GETPROP nodes are processed, it could lead to incorrect type annotations, supporting Hypothesis H1. Specifically, if the method fails to correctly infer or validate the type of `toLowerCase` as a string, it might not detect the absence of `indexOf`, resulting in the test failure."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType.findPropertyType(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType.findPropertyType(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure if the recent changes in type inference logic affect how properties are checked or retrieved. Specifically, if `hasProperty` or `getPropertyType` were altered to incorrectly handle edge cases, such as not recognizing inherited properties or misidentifying property types, this could lead to the mismatch observed in the test failure. The failure in `testIssue301` involves a property (`indexOf`) that should exist on `String.prototype`, and if `findPropertyType` incorrectly returns `null` due to a change, it would support the hypothesis that type inference logic is at fault."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType.defineInferredProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType (HH1),"The method `defineInferredProperty` is responsible for defining a property with an inferred type, which directly relates to type inference logic. If a recent change in this method altered how properties are defined or inferred, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches, supporting Hypothesis H2. Specifically, if the method incorrectly handles the `inExterns` parameter or the type inference for properties like `indexOf`, it might cause the failure observed in `testIssue301`, where a property is expected but not found."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in determining subtype relationships, which are crucial in type inference logic. If recent changes affected how `isSubtype` evaluates function types, especially in edge cases involving method calls like `isFunctionType()` or `getNativeType(JSTypeNative).isSubtype(...)`, it could lead to incorrect type annotations. The failure in `testIssue301` might stem from such a mismatch, where the expected warning about `indexOf` not being defined on `String.prototype.toLowerCase` is not triggered due to incorrect subtype evaluation."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,boolean,Node)",0.600000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue301"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.defineProperty` is responsible for defining properties on function types, and it specifically handles the ""prototype"" property differently by potentially invoking `setPrototype(FunctionPrototypeType)`. This behavior suggests that if there was a recent change in how properties are defined or how prototypes are set, it could affect type inference, particularly in edge cases involving prototype chains or property definitions. If the failure in `testIssue301` is related to a type mismatch due to incorrect handling of prototype properties, this method's behavior could support hypothesis H2 by indicating a potential area where type inference logic might have been altered, leading to unexpected results."

This method checks equivalence by evaluating properties like whether the types are function types, constructors, or interfaces, and compares the `typeOfThis` and `call` properties. If recent changes altered these checks or the logic for determining equivalence, it could lead to unexpected results, such as failing to recognize that `String.prototype.toLowerCase` does not have an `indexOf` method, thus supporting the hypothesis of incorrect handling of edge cases."

If a recent change altered how this method sets prototypes, it might lead to incorrect type inference, especially in edge cases where the prototype is not null and `prototype.setImplicitPrototype(ObjectType)` is called. This could result in unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the failure of `testIssue301`, where the type system fails to recognize `indexOf` on `String.prototype.toLowerCase`."

In the context of the failure, this method could support Hypothesis H1 if the recent changes in type inference logic affected how properties are recognized as declared, particularly for built-in types like `String.prototype`. If the logic incorrectly determines that `indexOf` is not a declared property on `String.prototype.toLowerCase`, it would lead to the observed mismatch in type annotations, thus supporting the hypothesis."
