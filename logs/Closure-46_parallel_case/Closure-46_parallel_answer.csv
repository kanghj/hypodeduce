com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getLeastSupertype(JSType),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `getLeastSupertype` is designed to compute the least supertype between two types, specifically handling record types by creating a new record type with common properties whose types are equivalent. In the failure context of `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2`, the expected result was a union of two record types, but the actual result was a record type with only the common property `b: string`. This suggests that the method may not be correctly handling the union of properties from both record types, supporting hypothesis H1 that the failure could be due to an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types. The method's logic seems to focus on common properties rather than forming a union, which aligns with the observed test failure."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry,Map)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry, Map)` initializes a record type with specified properties, ensuring that no property is null and defining each property before freezing the type. This supports hypothesis H1 because if the properties are not correctly defined or if the freezing process does not properly account for all properties, it could lead to an incorrect least supertype calculation. In the failure context, the expected union type includes properties from both record types, but the actual result only includes `{b: string}`, suggesting a potential issue in how properties are combined or retained during the least supertype calculation."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getGreatestSubtypeHelper(JSType),0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `getGreatestSubtypeHelper(JSType)` primarily focuses on determining the greatest subtype between two types, particularly when both are record types. It merges unique properties and checks for conflicts, which is a different operation from calculating the least supertype. The failure in `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2` involves the least supertype calculation, suggesting that the issue may not directly relate to `getGreatestSubtypeHelper`. Instead, the problem likely lies in the logic for merging properties or handling conflicts in the least supertype calculation, supporting Hypothesis H3 that the least supertype logic is incorrectly implemented."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.isSubtype(JSType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `RecordType.isSubtype(JSType)` supports hypothesis H1 because it involves subtype checks that could influence the least supertype calculation. Specifically, if the subtype determination is flawed, it might lead to incorrect assumptions about type compatibility, affecting the least supertype result. In the test `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2`, the expected least supertype is a union of two record types, but the actual result is `{b: string}`, suggesting a potential issue in how subtypes are evaluated or combined, possibly due to incorrect handling in `isSubtypeHelper` or the static `isSubtype(ObjectType, RecordType)` method."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.isSubtype(ObjectType,RecordType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `RecordType.isSubtype(ObjectType, RecordType)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2`. If the method incorrectly determines subtype relationships by not accurately checking property compatibility or existence, it could lead to an incorrect least supertype calculation. For instance, if `isSubtype` fails to recognize that `{b: string, c: string, e: number}` is not a subtype of `{a: number, b: string}`, it might incorrectly influence the least supertype logic, resulting in the unexpected type `{b: string}` instead of the expected union type."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `defineProperty` supports hypothesis H1 because it directly influences how properties are added to a record type, which affects the least supertype calculation. If properties are not correctly defined or inherited, it could lead to an incorrect least supertype result. In the test `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2`, the expected least supertype includes properties from both record types, but the actual result only includes `{b: string}`, suggesting a potential issue in how properties are combined or inherited during the least supertype calculation."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.isEquivalentTo(JSType),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `isEquivalentTo(JSType)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring structural equivalence between record types through property key comparison and recursive property type checks. In the failure context of `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2`, the expected least supertype was a union of two record types, but the actual result was a single record type `{b: string}`. This discrepancy suggests that the least supertype calculation might not correctly handle the union of properties from both record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch. The method's reliance on structural equivalence highlights potential issues in how the least supertype is determined, as it may not account for all properties correctly."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getImplicitPrototype(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `getImplicitPrototype()` returns the native `OBJECT_TYPE` for any record type, which does not directly influence the least supertype calculation between two record types. The failure in `testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2` is more likely due to an issue in how the least supertype is computed, rather than the implicit prototype, as the prototype remains constant and does not affect the properties or structure of the record types involved in the test. The mismatch in expected and actual types suggests a problem in the logic that determines the union of properties between the two record types, rather than their prototype handling."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.toMaybeRecordType(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the least supertype calculation for record types, leading to an unexpected type mismatch.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `toMaybeRecordType()` simply returns the current instance if it is a `RecordType`, without altering or influencing the least supertype calculation logic. This method does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it does not participate in the computation of the least supertype. The failure in ""testRecordTypeLeastSuperType2"" is more likely related to the logic within the least supertype calculation itself, rather than the behavior of `toMaybeRecordType()`."
