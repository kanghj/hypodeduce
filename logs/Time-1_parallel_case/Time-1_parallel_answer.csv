"org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType[],int[])",0.900000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual lengths of the `TypeArray` and `intArray` parameters, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during the constructor execution.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The failure in the test case does not support Hypothesis H1, as the error is not due to a mismatch in the lengths of `TypeArray` and `intArray`. The test case explicitly provides arrays of equal length, with `types` and `values` both having three elements. Instead, the failure is due to the requirement that the `DateTimeFieldType` array must be ordered from largest to smallest (e.g., year, month, day), which is violated in the test case. The constructor throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when this order is not maintained, as indicated by the assertion checking for a message containing ""must be in order"" and ""largest-smallest""."
"org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType[],int[],Chronology)",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual lengths of the `TypeArray` and `intArray` parameters, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during the constructor execution.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType[], int[], Chronology)` requires that the `types` array be ordered from largest to smallest fields, and it does not explicitly mention a requirement for the lengths of `types` and `values` to match. The failure in the test case occurs due to the `types` not being in the correct order, as indicated by the `IllegalArgumentException` with the message ""must be in order"", rather than an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This suggests that the failure is not caused by a mismatch in array lengths, contradicting hypothesis H1. The test case explicitly checks for the order of `types`, which is the actual cause of the failure."
"org.joda.time.Partial.getField(int,Chronology)",0.200000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual lengths of the `TypeArray` and `intArray` parameters, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during the constructor execution.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.getField(int, Chronology)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it focuses on retrieving a `DateTimeField` based on the index and chronology, rather than validating the lengths of `TypeArray` and `intArray`. The failure in the test case occurs due to an `IllegalArgumentException` related to the order of `DateTimeFieldType` elements, not an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The method's functionality is unrelated to array length mismatches, as it assumes valid indices and does not perform length checks."
org.joda.time.Partial.getChronology(),0.100000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual lengths of the `TypeArray` and `intArray` parameters, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` during the constructor execution.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.getChronology()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is unrelated to the array length mismatch issue. The method simply returns the chronology associated with the `Partial` instance and does not interact with the `TypeArray` or `intArray` parameters. The failure in the test is due to the order of `DateTimeFieldType` elements, not a length mismatch, as indicated by the assertion message expecting an ""order"" error. The constructor's logic checks the order of types rather than their lengths, which is why the test fails at the `fail()` call when the expected exception is not thrown."

This method does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it only provides the size of the `TypeArray` and does not interact with the `intArray`. The failure in the test is due to an `IllegalArgumentException` related to the order of types, not an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, indicating that the mismatch in array lengths is not the cause of the failure."
