org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.serializable(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the serialization configuration or version between the mock object and the expected serialized form, leading to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.serializable()` supports Hypothesis H1 by explicitly configuring the mock to implement the `Serializable` interface through `extraInterfaces(java.io.Serializable.class)`. This suggests that the mock should be serializable, aligning with the expectation that serialization should succeed. However, the failure indicates a potential mismatch in the serialization configuration or version, as the mock object (`IMethods$$EnhancerByMockitoWithCGLIB$$2d60e321`) is not being serialized correctly, possibly due to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getExtraInterfaces(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the serialization configuration or version between the mock object and the expected serialized form, leading to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getExtraInterfaces()` supports Hypothesis H1 by providing the list of extra interfaces configured for the mock object. Since the method only returns the configured interfaces without altering them, it suggests that any mismatch in serialization configuration or version is not due to this method itself. Instead, the issue might arise from how these interfaces are handled during serialization or deserialization, as indicated by the `NotSerializableException` for the mock object, which implies that the serialization setup might not correctly account for the extra interfaces."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.initiateMockName(Class),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the serialization configuration or version between the mock object and the expected serialized form, leading to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.initiateMockName(Class)` is unrelated to serialization configuration or versioning issues, as it solely focuses on initializing the mock's name by creating a `MockName` instance using the provided class and current name. It does not interact with serialization settings or influence the interfaces implemented by the mock. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, which concerns serialization configuration mismatches."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.defaultAnswer(Answer),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the serialization configuration or version between the mock object and the expected serialized form, leading to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.defaultAnswer(Answer)` is unrelated to serialization configuration or versioning, as it only sets the default answer for the mock and returns the current `MockSettings` instance. It does not interact with serialization settings or influence the interfaces implemented by the mock. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not affect the serialization process or the interfaces involved."
org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getSpiedInstance(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the serialization configuration or version between the mock object and the expected serialized form, leading to missing or extra interfaces during deserialization.",org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.MockSettingsImpl.getSpiedInstance()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is concerned with returning a spied instance rather than handling serialization configurations or interface mismatches. The failure in the test is related to serialization issues, specifically a `NotSerializableException`, which suggests that the problem lies in the mock's inability to be serialized, rather than in the presence or absence of extra interfaces. The method's functionality of returning a spied instance does not interact with serialization settings or influence the serialization process directly."
