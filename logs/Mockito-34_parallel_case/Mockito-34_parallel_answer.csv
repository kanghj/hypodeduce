org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values during the invocation, leading to incorrect argument capturing logic in the test.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `captureArgumentsFrom` in `InvocationMatcher` iterates over matchers and attempts to capture arguments from an `Invocation` if the matcher implements `CapturesArguments`. The failure, indicated by `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, suggests that the method attempts to access an argument index that does not exist, supporting hypothesis H1. This error likely occurs because the number of matchers expecting to capture arguments does not match the number of arguments in the `Invocation`, leading to an attempt to capture a non-existent argument."
"org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.InvocationMatcher(Invocation,List)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values during the invocation, leading to incorrect argument capturing logic in the test.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `InvocationMatcher(Invocation, List)` supports hypothesis H1 as it constructs an `InvocationMatcher` using either the provided list of matchers or initializes them from `invocation.argumentsToMatchers()` if the list is empty. In the failure context, the test uses a list containing a `LocalizedMatcher` for `AnyVararg.ANY_VARARG`, which may not align with the actual arguments of the invocation. This mismatch can lead to incorrect logic in `captureArgumentsFrom`, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to access non-existent elements, supporting the idea of a mismatch in expected and actual argument types or values."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMatchers(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values during the invocation, leading to incorrect argument capturing logic in the test.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMatchers()` supports hypothesis H1 by providing the list of `Matcher` objects used for argument matching, which are crucial for determining if the arguments in the invocation match the expected criteria. If there is a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values, the `getMatchers()` method would reveal discrepancies in the `Matcher` objects, potentially leading to incorrect argument capturing logic. In the failure context, the use of `AnyVararg.ANY_VARARG` suggests a possible mismatch in argument expectations, which aligns with the hypothesis that such mismatches could cause the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSameMethod(Invocation),0.300000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types, leading to an incorrect comparison during the argument capture process.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSameMethod(Invocation)` supports Hypothesis H4 by ensuring that the method signatures of the stored `Invocation` and the provided `Invocation` match. If there is a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types, this method would return false, indicating that the methods do not match, which could lead to an incorrect comparison during the argument capture process. However, since the failure is an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, it suggests that the issue might not solely be due to method signature mismatch but also involves handling of argument counts, which is not directly addressed by `hasSameMethod`."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.matches(Invocation),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values during the invocation, leading to incorrect argument capturing logic in the test.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.matches(Invocation)` supports hypothesis H1 by focusing on comparing the mock objects, methods, and arguments between the `Invocation` and `InvocationMatcher`. If there is a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values, the `ArgumentsComparator` may fail to correctly match the arguments, leading to incorrect capturing logic. The failure in the test could be due to the `InvocationMatcher` expecting a certain number of arguments or specific types, which do not align with the actual invocation, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to capture arguments."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual argument types or values during the invocation, leading to incorrect argument capturing logic in the test.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation()` simply returns the stored `Invocation` instance associated with the `InvocationMatcher`. It does not directly interact with argument types or values, nor does it perform any logic related to argument capturing. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not influence the argument capturing logic or handle mismatches in expected and actual argument types or values. The failure is more likely related to how `captureArgumentsFrom` processes the invocation, not how `getInvocation()` retrieves it."
