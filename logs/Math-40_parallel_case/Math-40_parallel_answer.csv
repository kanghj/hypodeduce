The failure in `testIssue716` is due to exceeding the maximum number of evaluations, which suggests convergence issues. The hypothesis H1 posits that these issues may arise from incorrect handling of edge cases where the function's derivative approaches zero. In `doSolve()`, the solver uses a bracketing method that relies on evaluating the function at various points to narrow down the root. If the function's derivative is near zero, the solver may struggle to make progress, leading to excessive evaluations without convergence. This supports H1, as the solver's inability to handle such cases efficiently could result in the observed failure."

The failure in ""testIssue716"" occurs due to a `TooManyEvaluationsException`, indicating that the solver exceeded the maximum number of evaluations (100) without converging to a solution. This supports Hypothesis H4, as the function `sharpTurn` has a derivative near zero at certain points, which can cause the solver to struggle with convergence, especially if the algorithm does not handle such edge cases effectively. The failure suggests that the solver's algorithm may not adequately address scenarios where the function's derivative is very small, leading to excessive evaluations without finding a root."

This setup does not directly address edge cases where the function's derivative is near zero, which could lead to convergence issues. In the failure context, the solver is configured with a high precision (`1.0e-12`, `1.0e-10`, `1.0e-22`) and a maximum of 100 evaluations, but the function `sharpTurn` has a very small derivative near zero, potentially causing the solver to exceed the evaluation limit without converging, thus supporting hypothesis H4."

This method uses n-th order inverse polynomial interpolation to estimate x-values, which can be sensitive to small derivatives or flat regions in the function. In the failure context, the function `sharpTurn` has a very small derivative near the root, which could lead to inaccurate root guesses and excessive evaluations, as indicated by the `TooManyEvaluationsException`. The method's reliance on interpolation in such cases may exacerbate the difficulty in converging to a solution within the allowed number of evaluations."
