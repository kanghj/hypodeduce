org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorialDouble(int),0.800000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial"" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `MathUtils.factorialDouble(int)` returns the factorial of a number `n` as a `double`, which inherently supports larger values than an `int` and reduces the risk of integer overflow. The failure in the test occurs due to a precision issue, as evidenced by the slight discrepancy between the expected and actual values for `17!`, rather than an overflow. This suggests that the hypothesis H1 is contradicted because the method uses `double` to handle large numbers, and the error is due to precision limits of floating-point representation, not integer overflow."
org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorial(int),0.300000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial"" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorial(int)` does not support hypothesis H1 because it computes the factorial using a precomputed ""factorials"" array and a double approximation, which avoids integer overflow issues. The failure in the test case is due to a precision error in the `factorialDouble(int)` method, as evidenced by the slight discrepancy between the expected and actual values for `17!`. The method throws exceptions for overly large results, indicating it is designed to handle potential overflow scenarios."
org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorialLog(int),0.100000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial"" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `MathUtils.factorialLog(int)` calculates the natural logarithm of a factorial, which inherently avoids integer overflow by working with logarithmic values rather than directly computing large factorials. This approach supports the hypothesis H1, as it provides a way to handle large numbers without overflow, contrasting with the failure in `testFactorial` where `factorialDouble` likely suffers from precision issues rather than overflow. The failure occurs at `17!`, where the expected and actual values differ slightly, indicating a precision error in `factorialDouble` rather than an overflow, which `factorialLog` avoids by design."
