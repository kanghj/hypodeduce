## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorialDouble(int)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `MathUtils.factorialDouble(int)` returns the factorial of a number `n` as a `double`, which inherently supports larger values than an `int` and reduces the risk of integer overflow. The failure in the test occurs due to a prec...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorial(int)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorial(int)` does not support hypothesis H1 because it computes the factorial using a precomputed "factorials" array and a double approximation, which avoids integer overflow issues. ...

3. **org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.factorialLog(int)** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testFactorial" could be caused by an integer overflow when calculating the factorial of a large number, resulting in incorrect or negative values. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `MathUtils.factorialLog(int)` calculates the natural logarithm of a factorial, which inherently avoids integer overflow by working with logarithmic values rather than directly computing large factorials. This approach supports...
