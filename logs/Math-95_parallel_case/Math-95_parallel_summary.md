## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.inverseCumulativeProbability(double)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)` is designed to find the critical point `x` such that `P(X < x) = p`. The failure occurs when handling very small degrees of freedom (1.0 for both numerator and denominator initially), w...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealFunction,double,double,double)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` attempts to find two values `a` and `b` such that `lowerBound <= a < initial < b <= upperBound` and `f(a) * f(b) < 0`, indicating a root of the function `f` ...

3. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getInitialDomain(double)** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `getInitialDomain(double p)` calculates the initial domain value for bracketing a CDF root by using the formula `d / (d - 2.0)`, where `d` is the denominator degrees of freedom. When `d` is very small, particularly close to 2,...

4. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getDomainLowerBound(double)** — score 0.805. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the F-distribution calculation for small degrees of freedom, leading to numerical instability or precision errors. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `getDomainLowerBound(double p)` returns a constant value of 0.0, which serves as the lower bound for bracketing the root of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the `inverseCumulativeProbability(double)` method. This ...

5. **org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealFunction,double,double,double,int)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` is used to find two values that bracket a root of a function, ensuring that the function changes sign between these values. In the failure context, the metho...

6. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(double)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` is designed to find the critical point `x` such that `P(X < x) = p`. The failure in the test case occurs when this method is called with a probabilit...

7. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getDomainUpperBound(double)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the degrees of freedom are set to very small values, leading to numerical instability or precision errors in the F-distribution calculations. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `getDomainUpperBound(double p)` returns `Double.MAX_VALUE` as the upper bound for the domain value, which is used in bracketing a CDF root during the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability. This supports Hypothesis ...

8. **org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision errors when calculating the F-distribution for small degrees of freedom. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `AbstractContinuousDistribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution()` is a default protected constructor that simply calls the superclass constructor and does not perform any calculations or handle floating-point precision. Theref...
