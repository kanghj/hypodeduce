The failure occurs when handling very small degrees of freedom (1.0 for both numerator and denominator initially), which can lead to numerical instability or precision errors. The stack trace indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid endpoint parameters during the bracketing process, suggesting that the method struggles with the precision required for small degrees of freedom, supporting hypothesis H1. The method's reliance on precise calculations for bracketing and solving may not handle edge cases well, such as when degrees of freedom are minimal, leading to the observed error."
"org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealFunction,double,double,double)",0.808632,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom"" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` attempts to find two values `a` and `b` such that `lowerBound <= a < initial < b <= upperBound` and `f(a) * f(b) < 0`, indicating a root of the function `f` is bracketed between `a` and `b`. In the failure context, the method is called with `lowerBound=0.0`, `initial=-1.0`, and `upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308`, which results in an `IllegalArgumentException` because the `initial` value is not between `lowerBound` and `upperBound`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the inappropriate initial value suggests potential numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom, leading to incorrect parameter values for the bracketing method."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getInitialDomain(double),0.806842,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom"" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3),"The method `getInitialDomain(double p)` calculates the initial domain value for bracketing a CDF root by using the formula `d / (d - 2.0)`, where `d` is the denominator degrees of freedom. When `d` is very small, particularly close to 2, this formula can lead to numerical instability or division by a small number, resulting in large or undefined values. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the failure could be due to precision errors when handling small degrees of freedom, causing the initial domain to be inappropriate for the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, leading to the `IllegalArgumentException`."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getDomainLowerBound(double),0.804526,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the F-distribution calculation for small degrees of freedom, leading to numerical instability or precision errors.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3),"The method `getDomainLowerBound(double p)` returns a constant value of 0.0, which serves as the lower bound for bracketing the root of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the `inverseCumulativeProbability(double)` method. This supports Hypothesis H3, as the constant lower bound of 0.0 might not be suitable for small degrees of freedom, potentially leading to numerical instability or precision errors when calculating the inverse cumulative probability. The error message indicates an invalid endpoint with an initial value of -1.0, suggesting that the bracketing process might be failing due to inappropriate bounds for small degrees of freedom."
"org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealFunction,double,double,double,int)",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom"" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` is used to find two values that bracket a root of a function, ensuring that the function changes sign between these values. In the failure context, the method is called with parameters `lowerBound=0.0`, `initial=-1.0`, and `upperBound=1.7976931348623157E308`, which leads to an `IllegalArgumentException` because the initial value is outside the specified bounds. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the failure could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom, causing inappropriate initial values or bounds that violate method constraints."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution.inverseCumulativeProbability(double),0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionTest::testSmallDegreesOfFreedom"" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling very small degrees of freedom in the F-distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution (HH1),"The method `inverseCumulativeProbability(double p)` in `AbstractContinuousDistribution` is designed to find the critical point `x` such that `P(X < x) = p`. The failure in the test case occurs when this method is called with a probability value `p` derived from very small degrees of freedom (1.0 for both numerator and denominator initially). The stack trace indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid endpoint parameters during the bracketing process, suggesting that the method struggles with convergence or precision issues when handling such small degrees of freedom. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the numerical instability or precision errors are likely exacerbated by the extreme parameter values, leading to the failure."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl.getDomainUpperBound(double),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the degrees of freedom are set to very small values, leading to numerical instability or precision errors in the F-distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl (HH3),"The method `getDomainUpperBound(double p)` returns `Double.MAX_VALUE` as the upper bound for the domain value, which is used in bracketing a CDF root during the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability. This supports Hypothesis H2 because setting the upper bound to such a large value can exacerbate numerical instability or precision errors, especially when the degrees of freedom are very small (e.g., 1.0 in the test case). The large upper bound might not effectively constrain the search space for the root, leading to difficulties in accurately finding the inverse cumulative probability."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution(),0.200000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision errors when calculating the F-distribution for small degrees of freedom.,org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution (HH1),"The method `AbstractContinuousDistribution.AbstractContinuousDistribution()` is a default protected constructor that simply calls the superclass constructor and does not perform any calculations or handle floating-point precision. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4 directly, as it does not engage in any operations that could lead to floating-point precision errors. The failure in the test is more likely related to the logic within the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method or the `bracket` method, where the actual calculations involving small degrees of freedom occur, rather than the constructor itself."
