"org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.MannWhitneyUTest.mannWhitneyU(double[],double[])",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.MannWhitneyUTestTest::testBigDataSet"" may be caused by insufficient memory allocation leading to an out-of-memory error when processing large datasets.",org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference.MannWhitneyUTest (HH1),"The method `mannWhitneyU(double[], double[])` processes two input arrays by first ensuring data conformance and then concatenating them into a new array `z`. Given that the input arrays `d1` and `d2` each have a size of 1500, the concatenated array `z` would have a size of 3000. This size is not excessively large for modern systems, suggesting that an out-of-memory error is unlikely. Therefore, the method's behavior does not support the hypothesis H1 that the failure is due to insufficient memory allocation. Instead, the failure is more likely related to the statistical computation or the assertion condition in the test."

The failure in `testBigDataSet` is due to an assertion error, not an out-of-memory error, indicating that the method's logic or statistical assumptions might be incorrect rather than a memory issue. Therefore, this method does not support the hypothesis H1, as it does not involve memory allocation processes that could lead to an out-of-memory error."

The failure in the test case is due to an assertion error, not an out-of-memory error, indicating that the method successfully processed the arrays without memory issues. The method's ability to handle the input arrays without throwing exceptions like `OutOfMemoryError` suggests that the failure is not related to insufficient memory allocation, contradicting hypothesis H1."

The failure in `testBigDataSet` is due to an assertion error, not an out-of-memory error, as indicated by the stack trace and the assertion condition `Assert.assertTrue(result > 0.1)`. Therefore, the method's functionality does not support the hypothesis H1, as the failure is related to the test statistic result rather than memory allocation issues."

However, the failure in `testBigDataSet` is due to an assertion error, not an out-of-memory error, as indicated by the stack trace.

Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not involve memory management or allocation. The failure in the test is due to an assertion error, not an out-of-memory error, indicating that the issue is likely related to the test logic or statistical calculation rather than memory constraints."
