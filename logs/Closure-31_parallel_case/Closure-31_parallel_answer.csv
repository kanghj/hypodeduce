com.google.javascript.jscomp.DependencyOptions.setDependencySorting(boolean),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.DependencyOptions (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.DependencyOptions.setDependencySorting(boolean)` directly influences the order in which dependencies are sorted by enabling or disabling dependency sorting. In the context of the test failure, the method's behavior supports hypothesis H1 because if dependency sorting is enabled (`setDependencySorting(true)`), the input files are sorted based on their dependencies, which could lead to variations in output order if whitespace handling affects dependency resolution. The test failure indicates a mismatch between expected and actual outputs, suggesting that the test might not account for these variations, thus supporting the hypothesis that differences in whitespace handling could lead to inconsistent sorting results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilationLevel.setOptionsForCompilationLevel(CompilerOptions),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilationLevel (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilationLevel.setOptionsForCompilationLevel(CompilerOptions)` supports hypothesis H1 by configuring the `CompilerOptions` based on the `CompilationLevel`, which includes handling whitespace. In the test, the `WHITESPACE_ONLY` level is used, invoking `applyBasicCompilationOptions(options)`. This configuration might not account for variations in whitespace handling across different environments, potentially leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results. The failure context suggests that the expected and actual outputs differ in order, which could be influenced by how whitespace is managed under this compilation level."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.compile(List,List,CompilerOptions)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH2),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.compile(List,List,CompilerOptions)` compiles a list of inputs with specified options, including handling of whitespace. The test failure suggests that the expected and actual outputs differ in the order of `goog.require` and `goog.provide` statements, which could be influenced by the `--compilation_level=WHITESPACE_ONLY` option. This option indicates that the compiler should preserve whitespace, potentially affecting how dependencies are sorted. Therefore, the method supports hypothesis H1, as variations in whitespace handling could lead to inconsistent sorting results, especially if the test environment or configuration does not account for these variations."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.initModules(List,List,CompilerOptions)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH2),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.initModules(List,List,CompilerOptions)` initializes the compiler's state for module-based sources, which includes setting up compiler options that could influence how dependencies are managed and sorted. The method's role in initializing options suggests it could affect whitespace handling if such configurations are part of the `CompilerOptions`. However, the method itself does not directly manipulate whitespace; it primarily sets up the environment for module compilation. Therefore, while it supports the hypothesis by potentially affecting configuration, it does not directly address whitespace handling variations, which are more likely managed elsewhere in the compilation process."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parseInputs(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH2),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parseInputs()` is primarily responsible for parsing the externs and main inputs to produce a synthetic root node, which does not inherently handle or modify whitespace. The method's focus is on parsing and structuring the input code rather than managing whitespace or dependency sorting. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve whitespace handling or dependency sorting logic. The failure in the test is more likely related to how dependencies are managed or sorted after parsing, rather than the parsing process itself."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.init(List,List,CompilerOptions)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH2),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.init(List,List,CompilerOptions)` initializes the compiler with a given set of external and input source files, along with specific compiler options. The `CompilerOptions` argument can include settings that affect how whitespace is handled during compilation. If the `options` parameter specifies a `WHITESPACE_ONLY` compilation level, it suggests that the method is designed to preserve whitespace, which should theoretically prevent variations in whitespace handling. However, if the `options` are not correctly set or if there are discrepancies in how different environments interpret these options, it could lead to inconsistent dependency sorting results, supporting hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.createOptions(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.createOptions()` configures a `CompilerOptions` object, which includes setting the compilation level to `WHITESPACE_ONLY` as specified by the test. This setting suggests that the method should handle whitespace consistently, aligning with the test's configuration. However, the failure indicates a discrepancy in dependency sorting, which might not be directly related to whitespace handling but rather to how dependencies are managed. The method's configuration of `options.setCodingConvention(new ClosureCodingConvention())` and other settings do not explicitly address variations in whitespace handling across environments, which could support hypothesis H1 if such variations affect dependency sorting indirectly."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.initConfigFromFlags(String[],PrintStream)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.initConfigFromFlags(String[],PrintStream)` processes command-line arguments, including the `--compilation_level=WHITESPACE_ONLY` flag, which directly influences how whitespace is handled during compilation. This supports hypothesis H1, as the method's role in setting up configurations based on flags could lead to variations in whitespace handling. The `processArgs(args)` call and subsequent parsing by `CmdLineParser` suggest that any discrepancies in argument processing or flag interpretation could result in inconsistent dependency sorting, aligning with the hypothesis that different environments or configurations might handle whitespace differently."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.processArgs(String[]),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CommandLineRunner.processArgs(String[])` processes input arguments by normalizing them to a format expected by the args4j library, which includes handling key-value pairs and stripping quotes from values. This method does not directly address whitespace handling in dependency sorting, as its primary function is to prepare command-line arguments for further processing. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any logic related to whitespace handling or dependency sorting. The failure in the test is more likely related to how dependencies are managed or sorted, rather than how arguments are processed by this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilationLevel.applyBasicCompilationOptions(CompilerOptions),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by the test not accounting for variations in whitespace handling between different environments or configurations, leading to inconsistent dependency sorting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CompilationLevel (HH1),"The method `applyBasicCompilationOptions` sets the `CompilerOptions` to skip all compiler passes, which means it only strips whitespace and comments without performing any dependency sorting or other transformations. This supports hypothesis H1, as the method's configuration focuses solely on whitespace and comment removal, potentially leading to variations in how dependencies are sorted if the test environment or configuration does not handle whitespace consistently. The test failure could arise from these variations, as the method does not enforce a specific order for dependencies beyond whitespace handling."
