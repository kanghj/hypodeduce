org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.getActualTypeArgumentFor(TypeVariable),0.910000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `getActualTypeArgumentFor(TypeVariable)` supports hypothesis H1 as it recursively resolves type variables, which can lead to a `StackOverflowError` if there is a self-referential generic type. The stack trace indicates repeated calls to this method, suggesting that the recursion does not terminate properly when encountering self-referential types. This behavior aligns with the hypothesis that a recent change in the reflection library might have altered type variable resolution, causing the method to mishandle such cases."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.boundsOf(TypeVariable),0.908632,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the Java reflection API that affects how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types in the test.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `boundsOf(TypeVariable)` recursively retrieves the `BoundedType` of a `TypeVariable`, particularly when the first bound is itself a `TypeVariable`. This recursive behavior can lead to a `StackOverflowError` if there is a self-referential generic type, as seen in the test failure. This supports hypothesis H5, as a change in the Java reflection API affecting type variable resolution could exacerbate or expose this recursive issue, causing incorrect handling of self-referential generics. The stack trace indicates repeated calls to `boundsOf`, suggesting that the method's handling of self-referential types is problematic."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.resolveGenericReturnType(Method),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `resolveGenericReturnType(Method)` supports hypothesis H1 as it attempts to resolve the generic return type of a method, which involves handling `TypeVariable` instances. The stack trace indicates a `StackOverflowError` occurring in `TypeVariableImpl.hashCode`, suggesting a recursive issue possibly due to self-referential generic types. This aligns with H1, as a recent change in the reflection library could have altered the resolution process, leading to incorrect handling of such types, especially if the method does not account for self-references properly."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.readTypeVariables(),0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered the handling of self-referential type variables, leading to incorrect metadata resolution in the test.",,"The method `readTypeVariables()` supports hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the `StackOverflowError` due to its recursive nature when handling self-referential type variables. The method iterates over each bound of the current type variable and calls `registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)`, which could lead to infinite recursion if the reflection library's recent changes altered how self-referential type variables are processed. The repeated calls to `getActualTypeArgumentFor(TypeVariable)` and `registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)` suggest that the method might not correctly handle cycles introduced by self-referential type variables, aligning with the hypothesis that recent changes could have affected this behavior."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.inferFrom(Type),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the Java reflection API that affects how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the test.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.inferFrom(Type)` supports Hypothesis H2 by potentially being affected by changes in the Java reflection API, as it relies on the reflection mechanism to infer type information from a given `Type`. Since it only supports `Class` and `ParameterizedType`, any recent changes in how these types are handled or resolved by the reflection API could lead to unexpected behavior, such as the `StackOverflowError` observed in the test. The call flow involving `TypeVariableImpl.hashCode` and `HashMap.get` suggests that the error might stem from recursive type resolution, which could be influenced by changes in the reflection API's handling of type variables."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.registerTypeParametersOn(TypeVariable[]),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `registerTypeParametersOn(TypeVariable[])` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the StackOverflowError if the recent change in the reflection library affects how type variables are resolved, particularly with self-referential generics. If the method iterates over TypeVariables and repeatedly calls `registerTypeVariableIfNotPresent(TypeVariable)` without correctly handling self-references, it could lead to infinite recursion. The stack trace indicates repeated calls to `getActualTypeArgumentFor`, suggesting that the registration process might not correctly handle self-referential types, aligning with the hypothesis of altered resolution behavior."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.registerTypeVariableIfNotPresent(TypeVariable),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `registerTypeVariableIfNotPresent(TypeVariable)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the StackOverflowError if the recent change in the reflection library affects how type variables are resolved, especially in cases of self-referential generic types. If the method is called recursively due to incorrect handling of self-referential types, it could lead to an infinite loop, as it checks and adds type variables to `contextualActualTypeParameters`. The stack trace indicates repeated calls to `getActualTypeArgumentFor`, suggesting that the method might not correctly handle self-referential types, aligning with the hypothesis of altered type variable resolution."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.registerTypeVariablesOn(Type),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the incorrect handling of self-referential generic types. It registers type variables and their actual type arguments, and if a type argument is a `WildcardType`, it resolves its bounds using `boundsOf(TypeVariable)`. If a recent change in the reflection library altered how these type variables are resolved, it could lead to a `StackOverflowError` when dealing with self-referential types, as seen in the stack trace where `getActualTypeArgumentFor` is repeatedly called, indicating a possible infinite recursion or mismanagement of type resolution."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$FromClassGenericMetadataSupport.readActualTypeParametersOnDeclaringClass(Class),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",,"The method `readActualTypeParametersOnDeclaringClass(Class)` supports hypothesis H1 as it involves registering type parameters and type variables on both the generic superclass and interfaces, which could be affected by changes in the reflection library. If the library's handling of self-referential generic types has been altered, this method's reliance on registering type variables could lead to incorrect processing, potentially causing a `StackOverflowError` when dealing with recursive type structures. The call flow involving `registerTypeParametersOn(TypeVariable[])` and `registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)` suggests that any change in how these registrations are handled could directly impact the resolution of self-referential types."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.readTypeParameters(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the reflection library that altered how type variables are resolved, leading to incorrect handling of self-referential generic types.",,"The method `readTypeParameters()` in `GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the StackOverflowError if recent changes in the reflection library altered how type variables are resolved. This method registers type parameters by calling `registerTypeParametersOn(TypeVariable[])`, which could recursively process self-referential generic types. If the reflection library's handling of these types has changed, it might lead to infinite recursion, as evidenced by the stack trace showing repeated calls to `getActualTypeArgumentFor`, ultimately causing the StackOverflowError."
