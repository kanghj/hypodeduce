If this condition is not met, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. In the test `testBadEndpoints`, the call `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)` does not satisfy this requirement, as the function values at 1 and 1.5 do not have opposite signs, leading to the expected `IllegalArgumentException`. The failure of the test indicates that the exception was not thrown, suggesting that the method did not correctly identify the non-bracketing condition, thus supporting Hypothesis H1."

In the test case `testBadEndpoints`, the call `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)` fails because the interval [1, 1.5] does not bracket a root of the sine function, leading to an `IllegalArgumentException`. This behavior aligns with the method's requirement for valid input, confirming that the failure is due to non-bracketing endpoints."

It throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the function values at the three points (min, max, and initial) have the same sign, indicating that the endpoints do not bracket a root. In the test case `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)`, the failure occurs because the function values at 1 and 1.5 do not bracket a root, leading to the absence of an `IllegalArgumentException` and causing the test to fail. This aligns with the method's behavior of requiring a valid bracketing interval."

If this condition is not met, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. In the test case `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)`, the endpoints do not bracket a root, which means the sequence may not satisfy the required condition, leading to the failure.

In the test case `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)`, the endpoints 1 and 1.5 do not bracket a root, but they do form a valid interval, which is why `verifyInterval` does not throw an exception. This indicates that the failure is not due to invalid interval endpoints but rather due to the lack of root bracketing, which is not checked by `verifyInterval`."

In the test `testBadEndpoints`, the call to `solver.solve(f, 1, 1.5)` is expected to throw an `IllegalArgumentException` because the interval [1, 1.5] does not bracket a root of the sine function, which aligns with the purpose of the `createIllegalArgumentException` method to handle such invalid input scenarios. The failure indicates that the exception was not thrown as expected, suggesting a potential issue in the solver's validation logic rather than the exception creation mechanism itself."

The failure in `BrentSolverTest::testBadEndpoints` is due to the test using endpoints that do not bracket a root, which is a separate validation concern from the iteration count and accuracy handled by `ConvergingAlgorithmImpl`. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not validate the bracketing condition of the endpoints."

Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in the test is likely due to the `solve` method being called with endpoints (1, 1.5) that do not bracket a root, which is consistent with the hypothesis that the test fails because the input does not satisfy the bracketing requirement expected by the solver."
