"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in validating scope calls during node traversal. Specifically, the method checks if a node is a call to a scope method and then validates it, which could lead to errors if hoisted function declarations are not correctly transformed or handled within the aliasing scope. The failure in `testHoistedFunctionDeclaration` might occur if the method does not properly account for the hoisting behavior of function declarations, resulting in the `JSC_GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL` error when the function `f` is not recognized as an alias within the `goog.scope`."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.validateScopeCall(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.validateScopeCall(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)` supports Hypothesis H1 by ensuring that function declarations within a `goog.scope` are correctly validated and reported if misused. In the failure context, the method likely identifies the function `f` as improperly declared within the `goog.scope`, triggering the `JSC_GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL` error. This suggests that the method's validation logic is consistent with the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of hoisted function declarations, as it specifically checks for and reports such issues."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.hotSwapScript(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.hotSwapScript(Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially mishandling hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope. During its traversal of the AST, it processes aliasing but might not correctly account for hoisted functions, as indicated by the error `JSC_GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL`. This suggests that the method may fail to recognize or transform hoisted functions as aliases, leading to unexpected errors. The call to `Traversal::hasErrors()` and subsequent actions like applying aliases and collapsing scopes might not adequately handle the nuances of hoisted function declarations, contributing to the test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.process(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure might be due to incorrect handling of hoisted function declarations. Since `process` delegates its logic to `hotSwapScript(Node, Node)`, any issues in handling or transforming hoisted functions would originate from the logic within `hotSwapScript`. The failure in `testHoistedFunctionDeclaration` suggests that the transformation logic might not correctly handle hoisted functions within the aliasing scope, leading to the error `JSC_GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL`. The call flow from `process` to `hotSwapScript` implies that any mishandling in `hotSwapScript` could directly affect the test outcome."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.enterScope(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.enterScope(NodeTraversal)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for handling scope entry and identifying alias transformations. When entering a new scope, it checks if the parent node is a call to the scope method using `isCallToScopeMethod(Node)`. If true, it logs the alias transformation and invokes `findAliases(NodeTraversal)` to identify aliases. This process suggests that if hoisted function declarations are not correctly identified or transformed as aliases, it could lead to the errors observed in the test failures, supporting the hypothesis that incorrect handling of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope might be causing the issue."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.exitScope(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.exitScope(NodeTraversal)` supports Hypothesis H1. When exiting a scope, if the scope depth is exactly 2, it calls `renameNamespaceShadows(NodeTraversal)`, which suggests that it handles renaming of variables that might shadow namespace aliases. This behavior aligns with the hypothesis that incorrect handling of hoisted function declarations could lead to errors, as the method's logic specifically addresses alias renaming and state clearing at this scope depth. The failure in the test might be due to improper renaming or state management of hoisted functions, which are not correctly transformed or aliased, causing the observed compilation error."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.findAliases(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.findAliases(NodeTraversal)` supports hypothesis H1 by focusing on identifying and handling alias declarations within a given scope. It iterates over variables in the scope, checking if they can be treated as aliases, and modifies the AST accordingly. If hoisted function declarations like `function f() {}` are not correctly identified or transformed as aliases, this could lead to the errors observed in the test failures, as the method might not handle such cases properly, resulting in unexpected behavior during compilation."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.renameNamespaceShadows(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.renameNamespaceShadows(NodeTraversal)` supports Hypothesis H1 by addressing the renaming of local variables that shadow forbidden namespaces, which could include hoisted function declarations. Since the method specifically targets renaming to prevent shadowing issues, it suggests that if hoisted function declarations are not correctly renamed or handled, they might lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as seen in the test failures. The failure in `testHoistedFunctionDeclaration` could be due to the method not adequately handling the hoisting aspect, resulting in the function `f` not being correctly scoped or transformed, thus causing the error."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.report(NodeTraversal,Node,DiagnosticType,String[])",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling or scoping of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing mechanism, leading to unexpected behavior or conflicts during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.report` supports Hypothesis H2 by indicating that the failure is related to incorrect handling of function declarations within the aliasing mechanism. Since this method reports errors and sets the `hasErrors` flag to true, it suggests that the function `f` is not being correctly scoped or aliased, leading to the `JSC_GOOG_SCOPE_NON_ALIAS_LOCAL` error. The error occurs because the function `f` is not recognized as an alias within the `goog.scope`, which aligns with the hypothesis that hoisted function declarations are not being properly managed during compilation."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.shouldTraverse(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testHoistedFunctionDeclaration"" might be due to incorrect handling or transformation of hoisted function declarations within the aliasing scope, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during compilation.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.shouldTraverse(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H1. It restricts traversal into functions unless they are specifically `goog.scope` functions, which suggests that the method is designed to handle aliasing within `goog.scope` blocks. In the failure context, the function `f` is not being treated as an alias within the `goog.scope`, leading to the error. This indicates that the method's logic might not correctly handle hoisted function declarations, as it prevents traversal into non-`goog.scope` functions, potentially causing the unexpected behavior observed in the test failure."
