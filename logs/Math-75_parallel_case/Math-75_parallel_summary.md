## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Object)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Object)` calls `getCumPct(Comparable<?>)`, which is responsible for calculating the cumulative percentage of values equal to `v`. The failure in the test case occurs because the e...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Comparable)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Comparable)` returns `Double.NaN` if no values have been added, which prevents division by zero errors when the total frequency count (`sumFreq`) is zero. In the failure context, ...

3. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(int)** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(int)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it does not handle division by zero errors. Instead, it converts the integer to a `Long` and delegates the call to `getPct(Compar...

4. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Comparable)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Comparable)` does not directly support Hypothesis H3, as it focuses on adding values to the frequency count rather than handling edge cases related to zero frequencies. The meth...

5. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCount(Comparable)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCount(Comparable)` returns the frequency of a given value `v`, and it returns 0 if the value is not comparable. In the failure context, the test case `assertEquals("three (Object) pct...

6. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(long)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(long)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it handles the conversion of a `long` to a `Long` and delegates to `getPct(Comparable)`. The failure occurs when calculating the...

7. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(int)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(int)` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero. It converts the integer value to a `Long` and del...

8. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(long)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(long)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that the frequency count for a given long value is incremented by 1, which means it does not directly handle cases where the frequency ...

9. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumFreq(Comparable)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumFreq(Comparable)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it primarily focuses on calculating cumulative frequencies rather than percentages. It handles comparability and edge ...

10. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumPct(Comparable)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumPct(Comparable)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it handles cases where no values have been added by returning NaN, thus avoiding division by zero errors. In the failur...
