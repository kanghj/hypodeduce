The failure in the test case occurs because the expected percentage for the value `3` (as an `Object`) is `0.5`, but the actual result is `1.0`. This discrepancy suggests that the method does not handle the conversion or comparison of `Integer` and `Long` types correctly, rather than an issue with division by zero, as the percentage calculation does not return `Double.NaN` or indicate a zero frequency count. Therefore, the failure does not support hypothesis H1, as the issue is more likely related to type handling rather than division by zero."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Comparable),0.808632,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(Comparable)` returns `Double.NaN` if no values have been added, which prevents division by zero errors when the total frequency count (`sumFreq`) is zero. In the failure context, the error occurs because the expected percentage for the value `3` (as an `Object`) is `0.5`, but the actual result is `1.0`. This discrepancy suggests that the method correctly handles zero frequency cases by returning `Double.NaN`, contradicting hypothesis H1. The issue is more likely related to how the method distinguishes between different types of `Comparable` objects, such as `Integer` and `Long`, rather than a division by zero error."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(int),0.806842,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(int)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it does not handle division by zero errors. Instead, it converts the integer to a `Long` and delegates the call to `getPct(Comparable)`. The failure in the test case occurs because the percentage calculation for the value `3` as an `Object` results in `1.0` instead of `0.5`, indicating a discrepancy in how the method handles different data types rather than an issue with zero frequency counts. The method's behavior suggests that the error is more likely due to type handling rather than division by zero."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Comparable),0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Comparable)` does not directly support Hypothesis H3, as it focuses on adding values to the frequency count rather than handling edge cases related to zero frequencies. The method converts `Integer` values to `Long` before adding them, ensuring consistency in data types but does not address division by zero scenarios. The failure in the test case occurs because the percentage calculation for the object `(Integer.valueOf(3))` results in 1.0 instead of the expected 0.5, indicating a potential issue with how objects are compared or counted, rather than a division by zero error."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCount(Comparable),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCount(Comparable)` returns the frequency of a given value `v`, and it returns 0 if the value is not comparable. In the failure context, the test case `assertEquals(""three (Object) pct"",0.5,f.getPct((Object) (Integer.valueOf(3))),tolerance)` fails because the expected percentage is 0.5, but the actual result is 1.0. This suggests that the method correctly handles zero frequencies by returning 0, thus avoiding division by zero errors. The failure is more likely due to incorrect handling of type conversion or counting logic, rather than division by zero, as the method explicitly returns 0 for non-comparable values, which would prevent division by zero."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(long),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getPct(long)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it handles the conversion of a `long` to a `Long` and delegates to `getPct(Comparable)`. The failure occurs when calculating the percentage for an `Integer` object, not a `long`, and the stack trace indicates that the error is due to an unexpected percentage value rather than a division by zero. The test case shows that the frequency count for the value `3` is non-zero, as evidenced by the expected percentage of `0.5`, which contradicts the hypothesis that the failure is due to division by zero errors."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(int),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(int)` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero. It converts the integer value to a `Long` and delegates to `addValue(Comparable)`, which increments the frequency count for that value. If the frequency count for a value is zero, the method does not directly address division by zero errors when calculating percentages. In the test case, the failure occurs because the percentage calculation for the object `(Integer.valueOf(3))` returns `1.0` instead of the expected `0.5`, indicating a possible mismanagement of frequency counts or type handling, but not directly due to division by zero."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(long),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(long)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that the frequency count for a given long value is incremented by 1, which means it does not directly handle cases where the frequency count is zero. The failure in the test case occurs when calculating the percentage for an object representation of the integer 3, which suggests that the method may not correctly handle the conversion or comparison between different numeric types, leading to an incorrect frequency count and thus a division by zero error when calculating percentages. The method's reliance on `addValue(Comparable)` implies that any issues in handling zero frequencies or type conversions would manifest in the percentage calculations, as seen in the test failure."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumFreq(Comparable),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumFreq(Comparable)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it primarily focuses on calculating cumulative frequencies rather than percentages. It handles comparability and edge cases by iterating over values and calling `getCount(Comparable)`, which suggests it is designed to manage cases where frequency counts are zero without causing division by zero errors. The failure in the test case is more likely related to how percentages are calculated or compared, rather than an issue with cumulative frequency computation."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumPct(Comparable),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testPcts"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the frequency count is zero, leading to division by zero errors when calculating percentages.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.getCumPct(Comparable)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it handles cases where no values have been added by returning NaN, thus avoiding division by zero errors. In the failure context, the issue arises from the assertion `assertEquals(""three (Object) pct"",0.5,f.getPct((Object) (Integer.valueOf(3))),tolerance)`, where the expected percentage is 0.5, but the actual result is 1.0. This discrepancy suggests that the method may not correctly handle the conversion or comparison of different numeric types (e.g., Integer vs. Long), rather than a division by zero error due to zero frequency counts."
