"com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.ParserRunner.parse(StaticSourceFile,String,Config,ErrorReporter,Logger)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.ParserRunner (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.ParserRunner.parse` is responsible for parsing JavaScript source code and returning its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Given that the failure occurs during parsing, this method is directly involved in handling the incomplete function definition in the test code. If there was a recent change in how this method processes incomplete function definitions, it could lead to the observed internal compiler error, supporting Hypothesis H1. The error message and stack trace indicate a parsing issue, which aligns with the method's role in converting source code into an AST, suggesting that changes in this method could indeed affect the handling of incomplete functions."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.ParserRunner.createConfig(boolean,LanguageMode,boolean,Set)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler that incorrectly handles incomplete function definitions, leading to syntax errors during the integration test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.ParserRunner (HH1),"The method `ParserRunner.createConfig` supports hypothesis H2 as it is responsible for creating the parser configuration, which includes handling syntax rules and error reporting. If there was a recent change in how the parser configures syntax handling, it could lead to incorrect processing of incomplete function definitions, as seen in the test failure. The method's role in initializing resource configuration and combining annotation names suggests it directly influences how syntax errors are detected and reported, potentially contributing to the observed internal compiler error."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parse(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parse()` initiates parsing by calling `parseInputs()`, which suggests that it directly handles the parsing of JavaScript code. Given the failure context, where an incomplete function definition (`""var foo = {bar: function(e) }""`) is involved, this method is likely responsible for processing such inputs. If there was a recent change in how `parseInputs()` or related parsing logic handles incomplete functions, it could lead to the observed internal compiler error, supporting Hypothesis H1. The repeated `RhinoErrorReporter.PARSE_ERROR` warnings further indicate issues during parsing, aligning with the hypothesis that changes in parsing logic might be the root cause."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.compileInternal(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH1),"The method `compileInternal()` supports Hypothesis H1 as it orchestrates the main compilation process, including parsing, which is directly involved in handling JavaScript code syntax. The failure occurs during the parsing phase, as indicated by the repeated `RhinoErrorReporter.PARSE_ERROR` warnings and the stack trace pointing to an `IllegalStateException`. This suggests that a recent change in the parsing logic within `compileInternal()` could lead to incorrect handling of incomplete function definitions, causing the internal compiler error."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parseInputs(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Compiler.parseInputs()` is responsible for parsing the externs and main inputs, creating a synthetic root node. This method's behavior could support Hypothesis H1 if recent changes in the parsing logic affect how incomplete function definitions are handled, potentially leading to the observed internal compiler error. The failure occurs during the parsing phase, as indicated by the stack trace and the test code, suggesting that the method's handling of incomplete syntax might be a contributing factor. If the method's logic for detaching and re-parsing file trees has been altered, it could lead to incorrect parsing of incomplete functions, aligning with the hypothesis."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.Config.Config(Set,Set,boolean,LanguageMode,boolean)",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler that incorrectly handles incomplete function definitions, leading to syntax errors during the integration test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.Config (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.Config.Config(Set, Set, boolean, LanguageMode, boolean)` initializes configuration settings for the JavaScript compiler, including IDE mode and language mode. The presence of the `isIdeMode` parameter, set to `true` in the test, suggests that the compiler is expected to handle incomplete code gracefully, which supports Hypothesis H2. If a recent change affected how the compiler processes incomplete function definitions, it could lead to syntax errors, as seen in the test failure. The method's role in setting IDE mode aligns with the hypothesis that the failure is due to improper handling of incomplete functions."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter.error(String,String,int,int)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter.error(String,String,int,int)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the JavaScript compiler is indeed encountering an error during the parsing of incomplete function definitions. The method is responsible for reporting errors by invoking `compiler.report` with a constructed error message, which aligns with the test's failure context where a `RhinoErrorReporter.PARSE_ERROR` is expected. The repeated invocation of this method with the same error type suggests that the compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions might be flawed, leading to the internal compiler error observed in the stack trace."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter.makeError(String,String,int,int,CheckLevel)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions, leading to incorrect parsing or execution during the test.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.RhinoErrorReporter.makeError` supports Hypothesis H1 by attempting to match error messages against known patterns to determine the appropriate `DiagnosticType`. If no match is found, it defaults to creating a generic parse error `JSError`. This behavior suggests that if the JavaScript compiler's handling of incomplete function definitions has changed recently, it might not correctly match the error message to a known pattern, resulting in a generic parse error. This could lead to incorrect parsing or execution during the test, as indicated by the repeated `RhinoErrorReporter.PARSE_ERROR` warnings in the test code."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.Node.Node(int,Node,Node)",0.300000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that incorrectly handles incomplete function definitions, leading to unexpected behavior during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.rhino.Node (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.Node.Node(int, Node, Node)` constructs a node with a specified type and two child nodes, ensuring that the left child node does not already have a parent. This method primarily deals with the structural setup of nodes rather than the optimization logic of the JavaScript compiler. Therefore, it does not directly support Hypothesis H3, which suggests that the failure is due to changes in optimization logic handling incomplete function definitions. The method's focus on node construction and parent-child relationships does not align with the hypothesis concerning optimization logic errors."
com.google.javascript.rhino.Node.addChildToBack(Node),0.300000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that incorrectly handles incomplete function definitions, leading to unexpected behavior during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.rhino.Node (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.Node.addChildToBack(Node)` primarily deals with updating the parent and next references of a node when adding it to the back of a node's children. It ensures that the child node does not already have a parent or a next sibling, which is unrelated to the optimization logic handling incomplete function definitions. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3 directly, as it focuses on node structure integrity rather than optimization logic. The failure is more likely related to how the compiler processes incomplete function definitions, which is outside the scope of this method's functionality."
