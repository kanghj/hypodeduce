In the test case, the method is expected to convert the Unicode character U+1D362 into its corresponding HTML entity `&#119650;`. However, the method instead produces `&#55348;&#57186;`, which indicates that it is treating the character as a surrogate pair rather than a single code point. This behavior supports hypothesis H1, as it demonstrates that the method does not correctly handle or escape high Unicode characters, leading to unexpected output."

This behavior supports Hypothesis H1, as it indicates that the method does not correctly handle or escape high Unicode characters, leading to unexpected output. The method likely processes the input string as UTF-16, resulting in incorrect HTML entity conversion for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane."

In the context of the failure, the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml` method is expected to convert the high Unicode character (U+1D362) into its corresponding HTML entity `&#119650;`. However, the test output shows it was converted into surrogate pairs `&#55348;&#57186;`, indicating that `entityName(int)` might not correctly map high Unicode code points to their expected HTML entity names. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the failure suggests that `escapeHtml` does not handle high Unicode characters as intended."
