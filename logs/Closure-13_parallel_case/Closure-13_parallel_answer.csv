com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.reduceTrueFalse(Node),0.800000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `reduceTrueFalse(Node)` supports hypothesis H5 because it directly manipulates boolean literals by replacing `true` and `false` with their numeric equivalents (`!0` and `!1`) during late optimization. This transformation could inadvertently alter the expected output of the test case if the test relies on the presence of boolean literals in the optimized code. Since the test output shows `true` and `false` instead of `!0` and `!1`, it suggests that the method's logic might not have been applied correctly or consistently, potentially due to recent changes in the optimization logic."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.optimizeSubtree(Node),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787"" could be due to a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.optimizeSubtree(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for applying peephole optimizations that can alter the JavaScript code structure. The failure in the test case `testIssue787` involves a discrepancy in the expected and actual output, specifically with the boolean values `true` and `false`. This suggests that the optimization logic, potentially influenced by recent changes, might have altered the code's boolean expressions or return statements. The method's role in simplifying and transforming code, such as through `tryMinimizeCondition` or `tryReduceReturn`, aligns with the observed output differences, indicating it could be a contributing factor to the test failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeCondition(Node),0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787"" could be due to a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeCondition(Node)` supports hypothesis H3 by potentially altering the expected output of the test case through its optimization logic. Specifically, the method simplifies boolean expressions, which could inadvertently change the output from `true`/`false` to `!0`/`!1`, as seen in the test failure. The recursive nature of the method and its application of logical simplifications, such as De Morgan's laws, could lead to unexpected transformations in the compiled code, aligning with the observed discrepancy in the test output."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeIf(Node),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787"" could be due to a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeIf(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering the expected output of the test case through its optimization logic. Specifically, it transforms `if` statements into conditional or logical expressions, which could lead to changes in the output format or structure. If a recent change in this method's logic affects how `if` statements are minimized, it could inadvertently alter the expected output, as seen in the discrepancy between the expected and actual results in the test case. The method's reliance on `isFoldableExpressBlock`, `getBlockExpression`, and `isReturnExpressBlock` suggests that any changes in these helper methods could also contribute to the observed failure."

Specifically, it attempts to replace `if` statements with more compact forms, which could inadvertently change the expected output of the test case. If a recent change in this method's logic affects how `if` statements are transformed, it could lead to discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs, as seen in the failure of `com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787`. The method's reliance on `isReturnBlock` to identify single return statements suggests that any modifications in this logic could directly impact the test results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.getBlockExpression(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787"" could be due to a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.getBlockExpression(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering the expected output due to its role in optimizing JavaScript code. It retrieves an expression node from a block with a single expression statement, which could lead to changes in the code structure during optimization. If a recent change in the compiler's logic affects how `isFoldableExpressBlock` determines foldability, it might inadvertently alter the expected output, as seen in the discrepancy between the expected and actual results in the test case."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.isPropertyAssignmentInExpression(Node),0.300000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.isPropertyAssignmentInExpression(Node)` checks for property assignments within an expression, which is unrelated to the optimization logic that alters the expected output of the test case. Since the failure involves a discrepancy in the boolean values (`true` vs. `!0` and `false` vs. `!1`) in the optimized output, this method's focus on property assignments does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H5. The method does not interact with the boolean optimization logic, suggesting that the failure is likely due to changes elsewhere in the optimization process."

This method's role in optimization suggests that changes in how return blocks are identified or processed could affect the test output. If recent changes in the optimization logic involve this method, it might inadvertently alter the expected output by modifying how return statements are optimized, supporting hypothesis H1."

This method does not directly relate to the failure in `com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue787`, as the test case failure involves a discrepancy in boolean literal output (`true` vs. `!0` and `false` vs. `!1`), which is unrelated to the transformation of bound function calls. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not impact the boolean literal optimization logic that is central to the test case failure."

Specifically, it replaces standard constructor calls with literal equivalents, which could inadvertently change the expected output of the test case if the optimization logic was recently modified. In the context of the failure, if the method altered the representation of functions or objects in a way that affects the test's expected output, it would align with the hypothesis that a change in optimization logic is responsible for the discrepancy."
