However, the failure in the test case occurs when a `NullPointerException` is thrown, which suggests that the method does not properly handle a null value within the array as expected. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's behavior contradicts its documented handling of null elements, indicating an unexpected null value is not being managed correctly, leading to the exception."

The failure in `testToClass_object` is due to a null value in the input array, which is not addressed by `addAbbreviation`, as this method focuses solely on managing string mappings for primitive types and does not involve any null checks or handling mechanisms that could influence the behavior of `ClassUtils.toClass`."
