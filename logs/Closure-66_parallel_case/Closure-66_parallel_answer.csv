"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.doPercentTypedAccounting(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testGetTypedPercent5"" may be due to recent changes in the type inference logic that incorrectly handle edge cases, leading to inaccurate type percentage calculations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `doPercentTypedAccounting(NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in `testGetTypedPercent5` due to its handling of node types. If recent changes in type inference logic have altered how node types are determined or counted, this could lead to discrepancies in the `nullCount` or handling of `unknownType`, affecting the overall typed percentage calculation. The method's reliance on `JSType` being non-null and not an unknown type suggests that any misclassification or miscounting of these types could directly impact the accuracy of the `getTypedPercent` function, aligning with the observed test failures."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.getTypedPercent(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""testGetTypedPercent5"" may be due to recent changes in the type inference logic that incorrectly handle edge cases, leading to inaccurate type percentage calculations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `getTypedPercent()` calculates the percentage of nodes typed by dividing `typedCount` by the total of `nullCount`, `unknownCount`, and `typedCount`. The failures in `testGetTypedPercent5` and `testGetTypedPercent6` suggest that the `typedCount` is lower than expected, resulting in a percentage of 62.5 instead of 100.0. This supports hypothesis H1, as recent changes in type inference logic could have led to incorrect handling of edge cases, causing some nodes to be misclassified as `null` or `unknown`, thereby reducing the `typedCount` and affecting the percentage calculation."

If there was a recent change in the type inference algorithm within this method or its call flow, it could lead to an incorrect calculation of the percentage of typed nodes, as seen in the test failures. The discrepancy in expected versus actual results in `testGetTypedPercent5` and `testGetTypedPercent6` suggests that the type checking process might not be accurately identifying or counting typed nodes, potentially due to such changes."

If recent changes were made to the type inference logic within the `TypeCheck` class or its dependencies (such as `ReverseAbstractInterpreter` or `JSTypeRegistry`), these changes could affect how types are inferred and subsequently how the typed percentage is calculated. The constructor's role in initializing the type checking process means any modifications in the logic it sets up could lead to discrepancies in type percentage calculations, as observed in the test failures."

Since it does not invoke other methods or contain logic for type inference, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2 directly. The failure in `testGetTypedPercent5` is more likely related to changes in the type inference algorithm itself, rather than this constructor, which merely sets up the environment for type checking."

If recent changes were made to the type inference logic, they could affect how types are inferred and calculated, potentially leading to inaccurate type percentage calculations. The method's reliance on `inferJSDocInfo.process` for JSDoc inference suggests that any modifications in JSDoc processing could also impact the type percentage, aligning with the observed discrepancies in the test results."

This method assigns `UNKNOWN_TYPE` to nodes lacking a type, which could lead to a lower percentage of typed nodes if recent changes in type inference logic result in more nodes being classified as `UNKNOWN_TYPE`. In the context of the test failures, if the type inference logic has been altered to misclassify certain nodes or edge cases, it could explain the discrepancy in expected versus actual typed percentages, as seen in the test failures for `testGetTypedPercent5` and `testGetTypedPercent6`."

The method's reliance on `getNativeType` and `ensureTyped(NodeTraversal, Node, JSType)` suggests that any modifications in these underlying methods could propagate errors in type inference, thus affecting the overall typed percentage reported by `getTypedPercent`."
