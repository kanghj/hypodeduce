## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver.doOptimize()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases in the SimplexSolver algorithm when dealing with single-variable constraints, leading to unexpected results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.optimization.linear.SimplexSolver (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `doOptimize()` in `SimplexSolver` constructs a `SimplexTableau` using the provided objective function, constraints, and goal type. If the algorithm does not correctly handle edge cases, such as a single-variable constraint, it...
