"org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getReducedFraction(int,int)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `Fraction.getReducedFraction(int numerator, int denominator)` explicitly checks if the denominator is zero and throws an `ArithmeticException` in such cases, which directly addresses the edge case of a zero denominator. This suggests that the hypothesis H1 is not supported by the method's behavior, as the failure in `testReducedFactory_int_int` is not due to a zero denominator but rather an issue with handling large negative numbers, as indicated by the assertion failure with expected and actual values of `-1073741824` and `-2147483648`, respectively."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(int,int)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `greatestCommonDivisor(int u, int v)` handles edge cases by returning 1 if either operand's absolute value is less than or equal to 1, which suggests it should correctly handle cases where the numerator or denominator is zero. This supports the hypothesis H1, as the method's logic should prevent incorrect fraction reduction or exceptions when zero is involved. However, the failure in the test case indicates a potential issue elsewhere, possibly in how the `Fraction` class handles large integer values or specific edge cases beyond just zero handling."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.reduce(),0.806842,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the `Fraction` class's reduction logic, which fails to properly simplify fractions to their lowest terms.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `Fraction.reduce()` supports Hypothesis H2 as it is responsible for simplifying fractions to their lowest terms using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The failure in the test case, where the expected and actual values differ significantly, suggests that the reduction logic might not be correctly handling edge cases or large numbers, leading to incorrect simplification. For instance, the discrepancy in expected and actual values in the test indicates a potential flaw in how the GCD is calculated or applied, which aligns with the hypothesis of incorrect reduction logic."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getFraction(int,int)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getFraction(int, int)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it handles normalization of negative values and overflow but does not specifically address cases where the numerator or denominator is zero. In the test `testReducedFactory_int_int`, the failure occurs with large negative values, suggesting an overflow issue rather than a zero handling problem. The method constructs the Fraction without further reduction, indicating that the failure is more likely related to overflow handling rather than zero edge cases."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.equals(Object),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.equals(Object)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it focuses on comparing two fractions for equality based on their numerators and denominators. The failure in `testReducedFactory_int_int` involves an unexpected value for a fraction, likely due to incorrect reduction or handling of edge cases, but the `equals` method itself does not handle reduction or edge case logic. The failure is more likely related to the logic in `getReducedFraction` or `reduce` methods rather than the equality comparison."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getNumerator(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getNumerator()` simply returns the numerator of the fraction without performing any calculations or checks, so it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in `testReducedFactory_int_int` is more likely related to the logic in `Fraction.getReducedFraction()` or the reduction process itself, rather than the accessor method. The test failure with expected and actual values suggests an issue with how fractions are reduced or represented, particularly in edge cases, rather than with retrieving the numerator."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getDenominator(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.FractionTest::testReducedFactory_int_int"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero, leading to an unexpected exception or incorrect fraction reduction.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.Fraction.getDenominator()` is a straightforward accessor that simply returns the denominator of a fraction without performing any calculations or validations. This method does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not handle or modify the fraction's values, including edge cases where the numerator or denominator is zero. The failure in the test is more likely related to the logic in the fraction creation or reduction methods, rather than this accessor method."
