If the method incorrectly identifies or applies type restrictions from the `restricters` map when analyzing `goog.isFunction`, it could lead to an inaccurate type inference, such as omitting `Object` from the expected type `(Object|boolean|number|string)`. The failure context suggests that the method might not be correctly refining the type of the parameter in the flow scope, resulting in the discrepancy between expected and actual types."

If a recent change in the Closure Compiler's type inference logic affected how `restrictParameter` applies these restrictions, it could lead to incorrect type handling, such as failing to include `Object` in the expected type `(Object|boolean|number|string)`. The method's logic of creating a child flow scope with a refined type or returning the original scope suggests that any misapplication of type restrictions could directly impact the test's expected outcome."

This discrepancy indicates that `caseTypeOf` might not correctly handle cases where a function type should be inferred as `Object`.

Since it only sets up the interpreter without altering type inference behavior, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in `testGoogIsFunction2` is more likely related to changes elsewhere in the type inference logic of the Closure Compiler, rather than this constructor method."
