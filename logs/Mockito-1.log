Hypotheses:
  H1 (confidence 0.700): H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual handling of varargs when using the `any()` matcher, leading to incorrect invocation counts.
  H2 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H2: The test failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual handling of varargs when using the `any()` matcher, leading to incorrect invocation counts.
  H3 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H3: The test failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual handling of varargs in the mock setup, leading to incorrect invocation matching.
  H4 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H4: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual handling of varargs when using the `any()` matcher, leading to incorrect invocation counts.
  H5 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H5: The test failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual handling of varargs in the method invocation, leading to incorrect verification of arguments.
