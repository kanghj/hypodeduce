org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues.returnValueFor(Class),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""should_return_empty_iterable"" may be failing due to a recent change in the default behavior of the `ReturnsEmptyValues` class, which no longer returns an empty iterable for certain input types.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues (HH1),"The method `returnValueFor(Class<?> type)` in `ReturnsEmptyValues` checks if the input type is a primitive or its wrapper and returns a default value for such types. If the method does not handle `Iterable.class` specifically, it may return `null`, leading to a `NullPointerException` when attempting to call `iterator().hasNext()`. This behavior supports hypothesis H1, as a recent change might have altered how `Iterable` types are handled, resulting in the failure of the test by not returning an empty iterable as expected."
