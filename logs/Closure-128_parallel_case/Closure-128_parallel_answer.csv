"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource(Node,Format,CompilerOptions,JSTypeRegistry,SourceMap,boolean)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource` is responsible for converting a syntax tree into JavaScript code, which directly relates to the formatting issue observed in the test failure. The test failure indicates a discrepancy in how object keys are printed, specifically with numeric keys being wrapped in quotes. If there was a recent change in the `toSource` method that altered how numeric keys are handled, it could support Hypothesis H1 by explaining the unexpected output `var x={[""0""]:1}` instead of the expected `var x={0:1}`. The method's role in formatting suggests that any modifications to its logic could directly impact the output, thus supporting the hypothesis."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build()` is responsible for generating and returning the source code, and it requires a root node to be specified. The failure in `testIssue942` indicates a discrepancy in how object keys are printed, specifically with numeric keys being enclosed in quotes. This suggests that the `build()` method, or the logic it invokes, may have been altered to handle object keys differently, potentially mishandling numeric keys by treating them as strings. If recent changes in the code printer logic affect how keys are formatted, this supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's output directly influences the test's expected versus actual results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String)` simply appends a string to the code and updates the line length without invoking other methods, indicating it primarily handles string concatenation. Since it does not involve logic for syntax handling or formatting decisions, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The issue in `testIssue942` likely arises from elsewhere in the code printer logic where syntax edge cases are processed, as `append(String)` lacks the complexity to influence such formatting outcomes."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode()` simply returns the accumulated code as a string and does not invoke any other methods, indicating that it is not directly responsible for any logic changes or syntax handling. Since it does not manipulate or format the code itself, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in `testIssue942` is more likely due to changes in other parts of the code printer logic that handle syntax edge cases, rather than the `getCode()` method itself."

The failure in the test case is due to the unexpected addition of quotes around the numeric key, which suggests an issue in the code formatting logic that processes object keys, rather than in the file finalization process. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not involve the logic responsible for formatting object keys."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node)` is primarily responsible for managing source mapping rather than directly affecting the syntax formatting of the output. Since it finishes source mapping for a node only if it matches the top of the mapping stack, it does not directly interact with or alter the code printing logic that formats object keys. Therefore, this method does not support hypothesis H1, as it does not handle syntax edge cases or influence the formatting of object keys like `0` versus `[""0""]`. The failure in `testIssue942` is more likely related to another part of the code printer logic that specifically deals with how object keys are printed."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setCompilerOptions(CompilerOptions),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setCompilerOptions(CompilerOptions)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially influencing the output formatting through the `CompilerOptions` object. Since this method clones the provided `CompilerOptions`, any recent changes in the options related to syntax handling could affect how the code printer formats specific syntax, such as object keys. However, since the method itself does not directly manipulate syntax or call other methods, the actual mishandling would likely occur elsewhere in the code printer logic that utilizes these options."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue942"" could be due to a recent change in the code printer logic that mishandles specific syntax edge cases, leading to incorrect output formatting.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node)` is unlikely to directly support hypothesis H1, as it primarily deals with initiating source mapping for a node rather than formatting output. The failure in `testIssue942` involves incorrect formatting of object keys, specifically the addition of quotes around numeric keys. Since `startSourceMapping` does not influence how object keys are printed or formatted, it does not directly contribute to the mishandling of syntax edge cases related to output formatting."

The failure in `testIssue942` involves incorrect handling of object key syntax (using `[""0""]` instead of `[0]`), which is unrelated to line length or line breaking. Since `maybeCutLine()` does not interact with syntax-specific logic or formatting decisions, it does not directly contribute to the observed failure."

The failure in the test case is related to the handling of object keys, specifically the addition of quotes around numeric keys, which is unrelated to line break preferences. Therefore, the issue is more likely rooted in other parts of the code that deal with object key formatting rather than in the line break logic managed by `notePreferredLineBreak()`."
