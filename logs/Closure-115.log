Hypotheses:
  H1 (confidence 0.700): H1: The failure of "unknown_test" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that introduced a regression affecting the test's expected output.
  H2 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H2: The failure of "unknown_test" may be due to a recent change in the codebase that introduced a regression affecting the test's expected behavior.
  H3 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H3: The failure of "unknown_test" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that introduced a regression affecting the test's expected behavior.
  H4 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H4: The failure of "unknown_test" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that introduced a regression affecting the test's expected behavior.
  H5 (confidence 0.700): Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that introduced a regression affecting the test's expected behavior.
