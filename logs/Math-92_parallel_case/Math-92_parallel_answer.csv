"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficient(int,int)",0.900000,H1,0.900000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testBinomialCoefficientLarge"" could be due to integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients, resulting in incorrect values.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficient(int, int)` returns a `long`, which can lead to integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients, as the `long` type has a maximum value of 2^63-1. In the test failure context, the expected result for `binomialCoefficient(48, 22)` was 27385657281648, but the method returned 27385657281647, indicating an off-by-one error likely due to overflow. This supports hypothesis H1, as the discrepancy suggests that the method's calculation exceeded the `long` capacity, resulting in an incorrect value."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficientDouble(int,int)",0.800000,H1,0.900000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testBinomialCoefficientLarge"" could be due to integer overflow when calculating large binomial coefficients, resulting in incorrect values.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficientDouble(int, int)` supports hypothesis H1. It calculates the binomial coefficient using a logarithmic approach and returns a `double`, which can handle larger values without overflow compared to `long`. In the failure context, the test `testBinomialCoefficientLarge` expected a result of `27385657281648` but received `27385657281647`, indicating a potential overflow issue when using `long`. The use of `double` in `binomialCoefficientDouble` avoids this overflow, suggesting that the failure could indeed be due to integer overflow in the `binomialCoefficient` method that returns a `long`."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.addAndCheck(long,long)",0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by an integer overflow occurring when calculating large binomial coefficients, leading to incorrect results.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.addAndCheck(long, long)` supports Hypothesis H2 by providing a mechanism to detect integer overflow during addition operations. When calculating large binomial coefficients, intermediate results may exceed the capacity of a `long` integer, leading to overflow and incorrect results. The method delegates to `addAndCheck(long, long, String)`, which checks for overflow and throws an `ArithmeticException` if it occurs. If this method is not used or fails to catch overflow in the binomial coefficient calculation, it could lead to the observed discrepancy in expected and actual results, as seen in the test failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.addAndCheck(long,long,String)",0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an integer overflow occurring during the computation of large binomial coefficients, leading to incorrect results.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.addAndCheck(long, long, String)` supports Hypothesis H3 by providing a mechanism to detect and handle integer overflow during arithmetic operations. In the context of computing large binomial coefficients, if an overflow occurs when adding intermediate results, this method would throw an `ArithmeticException`, indicating an overflow has occurred. The failure context shows a discrepancy in expected and actual results, suggesting that an overflow might not have been correctly detected or handled, potentially due to limitations in the overflow checking logic or its application in the binomial coefficient computation."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficientLog(int,int)",0.700000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by an integer overflow occurring when calculating large binomial coefficients, leading to incorrect results.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.binomialCoefficientLog(int, int)` calculates the natural logarithm of the binomial coefficient, which inherently avoids integer overflow by working in the logarithmic domain. This supports Hypothesis H5, as using logarithms prevents the large intermediate values that can cause overflow in direct calculations of binomial coefficients. In the failure context, the discrepancy between expected and actual results for large `n` and `k` suggests that the direct computation in `binomialCoefficient` might be susceptible to overflow, whereas `binomialCoefficientLog` would not encounter this issue due to its logarithmic approach."
