org.apache.commons.math.distribution.PoissonDistributionImpl.PoissonDistributionImpl(double),0.900000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the mean calculation in the PoissonDistribution class, leading to discrepancies between expected and actual results.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.PoissonDistributionImpl (HH4),"The method `PoissonDistributionImpl(double p)` requires the mean value `p` to be positive, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if `p <= 0`. This behavior directly contradicts Hypothesis H5, as the failure is not due to an incorrect mean calculation but rather the enforcement of a precondition that the mean must be positive. The test case explicitly passes a negative mean (-1), triggering the exception as expected, which aligns with the method's documented behavior and does not indicate a discrepancy in mean calculation."

This behavior supports the hypothesis H1 by ensuring that the mean must be positive, which aligns with the expected behavior of a Poisson distribution. The failure in the test is due to passing a negative mean (-1), which correctly triggers the exception, indicating that the implementation is functioning as intended and not due to an incorrect mean calculation."
