However, the actual output ""fredag, week 01"" indicates a discrepancy in week number calculation, which supports hypothesis H1 that the failure could be due to locale-specific differences in date formatting, particularly in how weeks are calculated."

The failure in `testLang645` is likely due to how the week number is calculated or formatted, rather than the two-digit number appending process itself.

The `init()` method's role in parsing the pattern and setting up locale-specific rules supports the hypothesis H1, as any discrepancies in how the pattern ""EEEE', week 'ww"" is interpreted for the ""sv_SE"" locale could lead to the observed failure.
