"org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.equals(CharSequence,CharSequence)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtilsEqualsIndexOfTest::testEquals"" could be due to a recent change in the StringUtils.equals method that incorrectly handles null values, leading to unexpected behavior during the test.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH3),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.equals(CharSequence, CharSequence)` handles `null` values correctly by returning `true` if both inputs are `null` and `false` if only one is `null`, which aligns with the expected behavior and does not support Hypothesis H1. The failure in the test case occurs when comparing `fooCs` with a `StringBuilder` containing the same characters, suggesting the issue may be related to handling different `CharSequence` implementations rather than `null` handling. Therefore, the method's handling of `null` values does not contribute to the failure, contradicting Hypothesis H1."
