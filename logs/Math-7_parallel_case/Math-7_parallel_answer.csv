"org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator.integrate(ExpandableStatefulODE,double)",0.710000,H1,0.600000,"H1: The failure in ""testEventsScheduling"" may be caused by a miscalculation in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect scheduling of events due to a precision error in the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator's step size adjustments.",org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator (HH1),"The method `integrate` in `EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator` is responsible for advancing the solution of differential equations by adjusting step sizes dynamically, which directly impacts event detection accuracy. If the step size adjustments are not precise, it could lead to events being missed or incorrectly scheduled, supporting hypothesis H1. The failure in ""testEventsScheduling"" could be due to such precision errors, as the method's step size control is crucial for accurately detecting events at specific times, like those expected by `SchedulingChecker`."

The precision of event detection in the `testEventsScheduling` could be affected by these parameters, as they determine the safety, minimal reduction, and maximal growth of step sizes. If these parameters are not set optimally, it could lead to precision errors in the step size adjustments, supporting hypothesis H1 that the failure might be due to a miscalculation in the event detection algorithm caused by these adjustments."

If the safety factor is set too low, it could lead to larger step sizes, potentially causing precision errors in event detection. This supports hypothesis H1, as an inappropriate safety factor could result in miscalculations in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect scheduling of events in the `testEventsScheduling` test."
org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator.setMaxGrowth(double),0.200000,H1,0.600000,"H1: The failure in ""testEventsScheduling"" may be caused by a miscalculation in the event detection algorithm, leading to incorrect scheduling of events due to a precision error in the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator's step size adjustments.",org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.EmbeddedRungeKuttaIntegrator (HH1),"The method `setMaxGrowth(double)` sets the maximal growth factor for the step size control in the integrator, which directly influences how the step size can increase during integration. If the `maxGrowth` value is set too high, it could lead to larger step sizes that might skip over event points, potentially causing precision errors in event detection. However, since the method only sets a value and does not directly interact with the event detection algorithm, it indirectly supports hypothesis H1 by suggesting that improper step size growth could contribute to the miscalculation of event scheduling."

If the `minReduction` value is too large, it could prevent the integrator from reducing the step size sufficiently when needed, potentially leading to precision errors in event detection. This supports hypothesis H1, as an inappropriate `minReduction` setting could cause the integrator to miss or incorrectly schedule events due to inadequate step size adjustments."
