## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.extractClassNameIfRequire(Node,Node)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: H1: The test "testRequire" may be failing due to a recent change in the Closure Coding Convention that altered the expected behavior or output format of the "require" function, leading to a mismatch with the test's assertions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `extractClassNameIfRequire(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering the behavior of how class names are extracted from `goog.require` calls. The method specifically extracts the class name from `goog.require...

2. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.extractClassNameIfGoog(Node,Node,String)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: H1: The test "testRequire" may be failing due to a recent change in the Closure Coding Convention that altered the expected behavior or output format of the "require" function, leading to a mismatch with the test's assertions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `extractClassNameIfGoog` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering how the class name is extracted from a `goog.require` call. If a recent change modified the logic within this method, such as altering the conditions unde...
