In the test `testMath789`, the failure occurs because the reconstructed matrix `rebuiltM1` does not match the original matrix `m1`, suggesting that `m1` might not be positive definite, which aligns with hypothesis H1. The discrepancy in the assertion (`expected:<0.0> but was:<0.0180652917341963>`) indicates that the decomposition did not handle the edge case of a non-positive definite matrix correctly, supporting the hypothesis."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix(),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases in the matrix dimensions, leading to an invalid decomposition process.",org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition (HH1),"The method `getRootMatrix()` returns the root matrix `B` such that the original matrix is equal to `B.B<sup>T</sup>`. In the failure context, the test `testMath789` expects the norm of the difference between the original matrix `m1` and the product `root1.multiply(root1.transpose())` to be zero, indicating a perfect decomposition. However, the assertion fails with a non-zero norm, suggesting that the decomposition process might not handle certain matrix dimensions or values correctly, supporting Hypothesis H4. The discrepancy in expected and actual results implies potential issues in handling edge cases, such as matrices that are near singular or have specific dimensional properties."
