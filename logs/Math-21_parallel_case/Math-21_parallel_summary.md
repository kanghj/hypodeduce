## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix,double)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecompositionTest::testMath789" could be due to an incorrect handling of edge cases where the input matrix is not positive definite, leading to unexpected behavior during decomposition. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `RectangularCholeskyDecomposition(RealMatrix, double)` is designed to decompose a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, and it throws a `NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException` if the matrix is not positive definite. In the test...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition.getRootMatrix()** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases in the matrix dimensions, leading to an invalid decomposition process. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.linear.RectangularCholeskyDecomposition (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `getRootMatrix()` returns the root matrix `B` such that the original matrix is equal to `B.B<sup>T</sup>`. In the failure context, the test `testMath789` expects the norm of the difference between the original matrix `m1` and ...
