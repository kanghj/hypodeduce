    Explanation: The method `getOptimaValues()` provides all function values at the optima found during the last optimization, which can help verify if multiple optima were found and assess their accuracy. If the returned values are close to the expected...

7. **org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer.getAbsoluteAccuracy()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the stopping criteria in the optimization algorithm, leading to premature termination before reaching the actual minimum of the quintic function. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiStartUnivariateRealOptimizer (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `getAbsoluteAccuracy()` retrieves the absolute accuracy from the underlying optimizer, which in this case is a `BrentOptimizer`. If the absolute accuracy is incorrectly set or interpreted, it could lead to premature terminatio...
