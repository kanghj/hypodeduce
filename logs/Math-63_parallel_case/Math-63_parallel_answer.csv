"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.equals(double[],double[])",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testArrayEquals"" could be due to a precision mismatch when comparing floating-point arrays, leading to false negatives in equality checks.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.equals(double[], double[])` checks for equality by first verifying if both arrays are null or have the same length, and then comparing each corresponding element using `equals(double, double)`. This supports hypothesis H1, as the method relies on element-wise comparison, which can be sensitive to precision issues inherent in floating-point arithmetic. If `equals(double, double)` does not account for precision tolerances, small differences due to floating-point representation could lead to false negatives, causing the test failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.equals(double,double)",0.700000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest::testArrayEquals"" could be due to a precision mismatch when comparing floating-point arrays, leading to false negatives in equality checks.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.equals(double, double)` checks for equality by returning true if both values are NaN or if they are exactly equal using `x == y`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method does not account for precision errors that can occur with floating-point arithmetic, potentially leading to false negatives when comparing values that are very close but not exactly equal. In the test `testArrayEquals`, if the arrays contain values that are nearly equal but differ slightly due to precision issues, the method would return false, causing the test to fail."
