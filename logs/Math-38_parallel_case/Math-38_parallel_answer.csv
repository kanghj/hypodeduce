"org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.prelim(double[],double[])",0.800000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `prelim` in `BOBYQAOptimizer` initializes several key variables and structures for the optimization process, including interpolation points and constraints. The failure context suggests that the test fails when using more interpolation points than expected, which aligns with Hypothesis H1. Specifically, the method's role in setting up interpolation points (`XPT`) and maintaining constraints (`XL`, `XU`) could lead to incorrect handling if the number of points exceeds the dimensionality constraints. The exception `PathIsExploredException` indicates that the method might not correctly manage the exploration of paths when the number of interpolation points is higher than the dimensionality allows, supporting the hypothesis of constraint mismanagement."
"org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.bobyqa(double[],double[])",0.800000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `bobyqa(double[], double[])` in `BOBYQAOptimizer` is designed to minimize a function using a trust region approach with quadratic models formed by interpolation. The failure context suggests that the method might not handle constraints correctly when the number of interpolation points exceeds the dimensionality constraints. Specifically, the exception `PathIsExploredException` indicates that the method might be exploring paths that violate the expected interpolation conditions, potentially due to incorrect handling of the constraints or miscalculation of the permissible number of interpolation points, which aligns with hypothesis H1. The hard limit calculation for interpolation points, `((DIM + 1) * (DIM + 2)) / 2 - (2 * DIM + 1)`, suggests a mismatch between expected and actual behavior when exceeding this limit."
"org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.bobyqb(double[],double[])",0.800000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `bobyqb` in `BOBYQAOptimizer` is responsible for handling the optimization process, including managing constraints and interpolation points. The failure context suggests that the test fails when using more interpolation points than expected, which aligns with the hypothesis H1. The method's handling of arguments like `N` (dimensionality) and `NPT` (number of interpolation points) is crucial, as incorrect calculations or constraints handling could lead to exceptions like `PathIsExploredException`. The failure at specific interpolation points (48, 59, etc.) indicates a potential issue in how `bobyqb` manages these constraints, supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of constraints when exceeding dimensionality limits."
"org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.BOBYQAOptimizer(int,double,double)",0.700000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `BOBYQAOptimizer(int, double, double)` initializes the optimizer with a specified number of interpolation points, which directly influences the optimization process. If the number of interpolation points exceeds the allowable limit based on the problem's dimensionality, it could lead to incorrect handling of constraints, as suggested by Hypothesis H1. The failure context indicates that the test fails when the number of additional points exceeds a certain threshold, supporting the hypothesis that the optimizer's handling of constraints is flawed when more interpolation points are used than the dimensionality permits."
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.doOptimize(),0.700000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `doOptimize()` in `BOBYQAOptimizer` performs validity checks on the bounds and constraints, which supports Hypothesis H1. The failure context indicates that the test fails when using more interpolation points than the dimensionality allows, suggesting that the optimizer may not correctly handle constraints or calculations when the number of interpolation points exceeds a certain threshold. The exception `PathIsExploredException` thrown in `prelim()` further suggests that the optimizer's logic for managing constraints or paths might be flawed when dealing with excessive interpolation points, aligning with the hypothesis that constraint handling is problematic."
"org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.setup(double[],double[])",0.700000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.setup(double[], double[])` supports Hypothesis H1. It performs validity checks on the problem dimension and the number of interpolation points, which suggests that incorrect handling of these constraints could lead to failures. Specifically, if the number of interpolation points exceeds the allowable limit based on the problem's dimensionality, as indicated by the hard limit calculation `((DIM + 1) * (DIM + 2)) / 2 - (2 * DIM + 1)`, the setup method might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to exceptions like `PathIsExploredException`. This aligns with the test failure when using more interpolation points than expected."
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.BOBYQAOptimizer(int),0.700000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `BOBYQAOptimizer.BOBYQAOptimizer(int)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure when the number of interpolation points exceeds the problem's dimensionality constraints. The constructor initializes the optimizer with a specified number of interpolation points, which directly influences the optimization process. If the number of interpolation points is incorrectly set beyond the permissible limit, it could lead to improper handling of constraints, as indicated by the failure for specific values like 48, 59, etc. The call flow to the main constructor suggests that the initialization logic might not adequately account for dimensionality constraints, supporting the hypothesis of incorrect constraint handling."
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.caller(int),0.100000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.caller(int)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is primarily a debugging utility that provides information about the call stack, such as the name and line number of the calling method. It does not perform any calculations or handle constraints related to interpolation points. However, it could indirectly support debugging efforts by helping trace the sequence of method calls leading to the failure, potentially identifying where constraints might be mishandled."
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.printMethod(),0.100000,H1,0.800000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of constraints within the BOBYQAOptimizer when using more interpolation points than the problem's dimensionality allows.,org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer (HH1),"The `org.apache.commons.math.optimization.direct.BOBYQAOptimizer.printMethod()` method does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it is primarily a debugging utility used for tracing the call sequence and identifying where in the code execution is occurring. It does not perform any calculations or handle constraints related to interpolation points. Therefore, while it may help identify where the failure occurs in the code, it does not provide evidence regarding the correctness of constraint handling or interpolation point calculations."
