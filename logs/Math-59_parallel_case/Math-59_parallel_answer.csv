The method returns `b` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, but it also checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is NaN, returning NaN in that case. This logic is flawed because the sum of `a` and `b` being NaN does not necessarily indicate that one of the inputs is NaN, and it does not handle cases where only one of the inputs is NaN. For example, in the test case `max(50.0, -50.0)`, the method incorrectly returns `-50.0` due to the logic `(a <= b)`, which does not account for NaN handling."

This indicates a potential issue with the method's logic when dealing with edge cases, as the method is expected to return NaN if either argument is NaN, but the failure points to a broader issue with handling float comparisons. The method's behavior contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it fails even with regular float values, suggesting the problem might not be limited to special values."

The failure in `FastMathTest::testMinMaxFloat` involves float inputs, specifically edge cases with NaN, which are not applicable to the integer-based `max(int, int)` method. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts H1, as it is unrelated to the handling of float or NaN values."

This method focuses on building trigonometric tables using functions like `slowSin`, `slowCos`, `splitMult`, and `splitAdd`, which are not involved in handling or evaluating NaN values in min and max functions. The failure in the test is more likely due to the logic within the `FastMath.min` or `FastMath.max` methods themselves, particularly in how they handle NaN values, rather than any trigonometric table computations."

The failure in `FastMathTest::testMinMaxFloat` is specifically about the incorrect handling of edge cases involving NaN values in min/max functions, which is not addressed by the `expint` method. Therefore, `expint` neither supports nor contradicts H1, as it does not involve logic related to NaN handling in min/max computations."

Therefore, `quadMult` neither supports nor contradicts H1, as it does not involve logic for handling NaN values in min or max operations."

The failure in `testMinMaxFloat` is specifically about the behavior of min and max functions with float inputs, particularly with NaN values, which `resplit` does not address or influence. Therefore, `resplit` neither supports nor contradicts H1, as it operates on a different aspect of numerical computation."

The method focuses on computing the cosine of a value using a Taylor series, which involves operations on split double values rather than handling special float values.

The failure in `testMinMaxFloat` is specifically about the behavior of min and max functions with NaN inputs, whereas `slowLog` focuses on logarithmic calculations and does not involve comparisons or decision-making logic that would affect NaN handling in min/max operations. Therefore, the `slowLog` method's functionality does not provide evidence for or against the hypothesis regarding NaN handling in the min and max functions."
