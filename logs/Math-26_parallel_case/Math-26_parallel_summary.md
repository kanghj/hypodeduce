## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.Fraction(double,double,int)** — score 70.000. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.FractionTest::testIntegerOverflow" could be caused by an arithmetic operation within the Fraction class that does not properly handle integer overflow, leading to incorrect results when dealing with large numerators or denominators. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Fraction(double value, double epsilon, int maxIterations)` in the `Fraction` class does not directly handle integer overflow but delegates to another constructor with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as a parameter, which suggests it allo...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.Fraction(int,int)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.FractionTest::testIntegerOverflow" could be caused by an arithmetic operation within the Fraction class that does not properly handle integer overflow, leading to incorrect results when dealing with large numerators or denominators. (confidence 0.800); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Fraction(int num, int den)` in the `Fraction` class does not explicitly handle integer overflow for the numerator or denominator, as it primarily checks for a zero denominator and reduces the fraction to its lowest terms. Giv...
