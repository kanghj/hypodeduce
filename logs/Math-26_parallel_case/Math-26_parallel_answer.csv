"org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.Fraction(double,double,int)",70.000000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.FractionTest::testIntegerOverflow"" could be caused by an arithmetic operation within the Fraction class that does not properly handle integer overflow, leading to incorrect results when dealing with large numerators or denominators.",org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction (HH1),"The method `Fraction(double value, double epsilon, int maxIterations)` in the `Fraction` class does not directly handle integer overflow but delegates to another constructor with `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as a parameter, which suggests it allows for very large numerators or denominators. This supports Hypothesis H1, as using `Integer.MAX_VALUE` could lead to integer overflow if the arithmetic operations within the class do not properly handle such large values, potentially causing the failure observed in the test when dealing with extreme values like `-1.0e10`."
"org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction.Fraction(int,int)",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.FractionTest::testIntegerOverflow"" could be caused by an arithmetic operation within the Fraction class that does not properly handle integer overflow, leading to incorrect results when dealing with large numerators or denominators.",org.apache.commons.math3.fraction.Fraction (HH1),"The method `Fraction(int num, int den)` in the `Fraction` class does not explicitly handle integer overflow for the numerator or denominator, as it primarily checks for a zero denominator and reduces the fraction to its lowest terms. Given the failure context, the hypothesis H1 is supported because the method does not include checks for integer overflow, which could lead to incorrect results when large values like `-1.0e10` are used, potentially causing arithmetic operations to exceed the limits of integer representation. The absence of overflow handling in the constructor aligns with the failure observed in the test case."
