"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitCall(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitCall(NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H2 as it directly interacts with the type inference logic by checking if a node's type can be called (`canBeCalled()`), which is crucial in determining if the function call is valid. In the failure context, the mismatch between the expected and actual parameter types suggests that the recent changes in type inference might have altered how `restrictByNotNullOrUndefined()` or `canBeCalled()` functions, leading to incorrect handling of edge cases like the one in the test. The error message indicates a type mismatch, which aligns with the hypothesis that the type inference logic might be incorrectly processing the function types, resulting in unexpected warnings."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.checkFunctionEquivalenceHelper(FunctionType,EquivalenceMethod)",0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles edge cases involving complex nested types.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.checkFunctionEquivalenceHelper(FunctionType, EquivalenceMethod)` checks if two function types are equivalent by comparing their signatures or names. In the context of the failure in `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058`, the method's logic of comparing function signatures could support Hypothesis H3 if a recent change in the type inference algorithm altered how function signatures are interpreted, especially for complex nested types. The error message indicates a type mismatch between the actual and required function types, suggesting that the equivalence check might not be handling nested types correctly, aligning with the hypothesis of a recent change affecting edge cases."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in determining subtype relationships between function types. In the test failure, the expected parameter type for `Class.prototype.foo` is `function((number|string)): (number|string)`, but the actual parameter provided is `function(number): string`. The `isSubtype` method would evaluate whether the actual function type is a subtype of the expected function type, and if recent changes in the type inference logic affected this evaluation, it could lead to the observed type mismatch. The failure suggests that the subtype check did not recognize the provided function as a valid subtype, which aligns with the hypothesis of a recent change affecting edge case handling."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.resolveInternal(ErrorReporter,StaticScope)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.resolveInternal(ErrorReporter, StaticScope)` is responsible for resolving the function type and its components, which includes handling the function's parameter and return types. In the context of the failure in `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058`, this method could support hypothesis H1 if recent changes in the type inference logic affected how `resolveInternal` processes function types, particularly in resolving parameter types like `function(CLASS):CLASS` versus `function(number):string`. The mismatch error indicates that the function type resolution might not be correctly handling the template types, leading to the unexpected type mismatch, which aligns with the hypothesis of a recent change affecting edge cases in type inference."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` is central to type checking by handling different types of parse tree nodes through a switch statement. This method's role in type inference suggests it could support hypothesis H1 if recent changes in its logic introduced errors in handling specific node types, leading to type mismatches like those seen in `testIssue1058`. The failure context indicates a mismatch between expected and actual parameter types, which could result from incorrect type inference logic in the `visit` method, especially if recent changes affected how function types are inferred or compared."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitFunction(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitFunction(NodeTraversal, Node)` processes function nodes by examining their types and names, which directly relates to type inference logic. In the failure context, the type mismatch error indicates that the function `foo` expects a parameter of type `function((number|string)): (number|string)`, but receives `function(number): string`. This suggests that the method might not correctly infer or propagate type constraints for template types, supporting hypothesis H2. The recent changes in type inference logic could have altered how `visitFunction` interprets or assigns types, leading to the observed mismatch."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitParameterList(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1058"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitParameterList(NodeTraversal, Node, FunctionType)` is responsible for checking the types of arguments passed to a function call against the expected parameter types defined in the function's signature. In the failure context of `testIssue1058`, the method identifies a type mismatch between the actual parameter type `function (number): string` and the expected type `function ((number|string)): (number|string)`. This suggests that the method's logic for type inference or validation might have been altered, potentially supporting Hypothesis H1, as it indicates a stricter or incorrect handling of type templates, leading to the unexpected type mismatch. The failure occurs when the method processes the parameter list and finds that the provided function does not match the expected template constraints."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.TemplatizedType.TemplatizedType(JSTypeRegistry,ObjectType,ImmutableList)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.TemplatizedType (HH1),"The method `TemplatizedType.TemplatizedType(JSTypeRegistry, ObjectType, ImmutableList)` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to the failure through its handling of template types. It initializes a `TemplatizedType` by updating the `TemplateTypeMap` with provided template types, which could lead to incorrect type inference if recent changes affected how these template types are resolved or filled. The mismatch between expected and actual type annotations in the test failure suggests that the logic in this constructor might not correctly handle certain edge cases, aligning with the hypothesis of a recent change impacting type inference."

In the failure context of `testIssue1058`, the mismatch between the expected and actual parameter types suggests that template types might not be properly instantiated or inferred, supporting hypothesis H1. The presence of unfilled template keys or unresolved template types, as checked by this method, aligns with the type mismatch error observed, indicating a potential issue in handling template types in recent changes."

In the failure context of `testIssue1058`, the method would return the type `string` for the function `Class.prototype.foo`, which contradicts the expected type `(number|string)`. This mismatch suggests that the type inference logic might not be correctly handling the return type, supporting hypothesis H1 that recent changes could have introduced errors in handling edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches."
