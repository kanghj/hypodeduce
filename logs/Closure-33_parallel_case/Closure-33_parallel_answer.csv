"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitObjLitKey(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles certain edge cases, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type annotations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitObjLitKey(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` is responsible for handling object literal field definitions and modifying object type schemas when prototype modifications are detected. This method does not directly perform type inference but rather adjusts object schemas based on the traversal context. The failure context indicates a type mismatch between expected and actual types, suggesting that the issue might not be directly related to `visitObjLitKey` but rather to how type inference or type checking is applied elsewhere in the code. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2 directly, as it does not engage in type inference but rather in schema adjustments."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitParameterList(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitParameterList(NodeTraversal, Node, FunctionType)` is responsible for checking the types of parameters passed to a function call against the expected types defined in the function's signature. In the failure context, the error message indicates a type mismatch between the actual parameter and the required parameter types. This suggests that the method might not be handling type coercion correctly, particularly when dealing with complex types like objects with optional properties. The hypothesis H1 is supported if recent changes in the type inference logic affect how `visitParameterList` interprets or enforces type constraints, leading to stricter or incorrect type checks in edge cases involving optional or undefined properties."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node,boolean)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node, boolean)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure could be due to a recent change in type inference logic. This method traverses the node with type checking and processes JSDoc information, which suggests that any modifications in how JSDoc types are inferred or coerced could lead to unexpected type mismatches. The error message indicates a type mismatch between the actual and required parameter types, which aligns with the possibility of incorrect handling of type coercion in edge cases. The call to `inferJSDocInfo.process` further implies that changes in processing JSDoc annotations could directly impact type inference outcomes."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType,String,JSDocInfo,JSType)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles edge cases involving complex nested types.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance` primarily focuses on validating `@override` annotations and ensuring property inheritance correctness in constructors and interfaces. It does not directly handle type inference for complex nested types, which is the focus of Hypothesis H4. The failure in `testIssue700` involves a type mismatch error related to nested types, suggesting that the issue might not be directly related to this method's functionality. Instead, the problem could stem from another part of the type inference algorithm that deals with nested types, as this method does not address such scenarios."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyAccess(JSType,String,NodeTraversal,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyAccess(JSType, String, NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure through its role in type checking. It emits warnings when a property cannot be defined on an object, which aligns with the failure context where a type mismatch warning is generated. The method's reliance on type information and its invocation of `getJSType` and `checkPropertyAccessHelper` suggest that any recent changes in type inference logic, especially those affecting type coercion, could lead to incorrect handling of edge cases, resulting in unexpected warnings as seen in the test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.process(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is the main entry point for type checking, which involves verifying type correctness across the code. The failure in `testIssue700` is related to a type mismatch, suggesting that the type inference logic might not be handling type coercion correctly. The method's responsibility to ensure type correctness and its invocation of the ""check"" method on the JS root implies that any recent changes in type inference logic could directly affect its behavior, potentially leading to the observed failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.processForTesting(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.processForTesting(Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it is directly involved in setting up the scope and running type inference before performing type checking. If there was a recent change in the type inference logic, it would affect this method's execution, potentially leading to incorrect handling of edge cases related to type coercion. The failure in `testIssue700` could be attributed to this, as the method's role in type inference and checking is crucial, and any changes in its logic could result in unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the test output."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.shouldTraverse(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.shouldTraverse(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` primarily determines whether a node should be traversed and manages sections marked with `@notypecheck`. This method's role in handling `@notypecheck` sections suggests it could influence how type checks are applied or skipped, potentially affecting type inference logic. If recent changes altered how `@notypecheck` is processed, it might lead to incorrect handling of type coercion in edge cases, supporting Hypothesis H1. However, without specific changes to this method related to type inference, it does not directly contradict the hypothesis."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` is central to the type checking process, handling various parse tree nodes and their associated type checks. The failure in `testIssue700` involves a type mismatch error, suggesting that the type inference logic might not be correctly handling certain edge cases, such as type coercion. The method's role in processing node types and performing type checks supports the hypothesis H1, as any recent changes in this method's logic could directly impact how types are inferred and checked, potentially leading to the observed failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitAssign(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue700"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases related to type coercion.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitAssign(NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially influencing type inference logic through its handling of assignment nodes and type validation. Specifically, it calls `validator.expectCanAssignToPropertyOf` and `ensureTyped`, which are crucial for type checking and could be affected by changes in type inference logic. If recent changes altered how these functions interpret or enforce type constraints, it could lead to incorrect handling of edge cases related to type coercion, as seen in the failure of `testIssue700`. The method's role in validating assignments and ensuring types align with expectations directly ties into the type mismatch error observed in the test."
