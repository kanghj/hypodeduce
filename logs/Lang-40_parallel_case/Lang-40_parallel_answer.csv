"org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.containsIgnoreCase(String,String)",0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by the `containsIgnoreCase` method not correctly handling locale-specific case mappings, leading to incorrect results in certain locales.",org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils (HH1),"The `containsIgnoreCase` method in `org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils` converts both the input string and the search string to uppercase using `toUpperCase()` before checking for containment. This approach can lead to incorrect results in certain locales, such as Turkish, where the uppercase conversion of 'i' is not 'I'. The test failure in `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` suggests that the method does not correctly handle locale-specific case mappings, supporting hypothesis H1, as evidenced by the failure when testing with the Turkish locale."
"org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.contains(String,String)",0.800000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The test failure may be caused by a locale-specific character comparison issue where certain characters are treated differently in different locales, affecting the case-insensitive containment check.",org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils.contains(String, String)` uses `String#indexOf` to check for containment, which is inherently case-sensitive and locale-independent. However, the test `testContainsIgnoreCase_LocaleIndependence` suggests a failure due to locale-specific character comparison, particularly with the German ""ÃŸ"" and ""SS"". This indicates that the method does not handle locale-specific case transformations, supporting Hypothesis H4 that the failure is due to locale-specific character handling, as seen with the Turkish locale affecting the case-insensitive check."
