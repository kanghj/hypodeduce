com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeIf(Node),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `tryMinimizeIf(Node n)` attempts to convert `IF` nodes into more compact `HOOK` expressions. The test failures indicate that the transformation logic might be incorrectly handling the decrement operation (`--y`) and post-increment operation (`x++`) within the condition, leading to incorrect rearrangement of expressions. Specifically, the expected output and the actual result differ in the order of operations and assignment, suggesting that the method's logic might not correctly account for side effects of these operations, supporting hypothesis H1 that a recent change in optimization logic could be causing these issues."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryReplaceIf(Node),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `tryReplaceIf(Node n)` iterates over child nodes to identify `if` statements and attempts to replace them with a conditional (ternary) expression. The test failures indicate that the transformation logic might incorrectly reorder or misinterpret the operands and assignments, as seen in the discrepancy between expected and actual outputs (e.g., `x[--y]===1?x[y]=0:x[y]=1` vs. `x[y]=x[--y]===1?0:1`). This suggests that recent changes in the optimization logic could have introduced errors in handling specific syntax patterns, supporting hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.optimizeSubtree(Node),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `optimizeSubtree(Node)` in `PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly applies peephole optimizations that could alter the syntax patterns related to issue 925. The test failures indicate discrepancies in handling conditional expressions, which `optimizeSubtree` might influence through its calls to methods like `tryReplaceIf` and `tryMinimizeIf`. These methods are responsible for transforming `if` statements into conditional expressions, and any recent changes in their logic could lead to the observed test failures, suggesting a potential misoptimization in handling decrement operations or post-increment expressions."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryMinimizeCondition(Node),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `tryMinimizeCondition(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it focuses on minimizing boolean condition expressions, which aligns with the test failures related to conditional expressions. The method's recursive nature and its role in logical simplifications suggest that recent changes in its logic could inadvertently alter the handling of specific syntax patterns, such as those in issue 925. The discrepancies in expected versus actual output, like the rearrangement of expressions (e.g., `x[--y]===1?x[y]=0:x[y]=1` vs. `x[y]=x[--y]===1?0:1`), indicate potential mishandling during optimization, possibly due to recent modifications in this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.getBlockExpression(Node),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `getBlockExpression(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly interacts with the optimization logic by determining whether a block is a foldable expression block. If recent changes in the `isFoldableExpressBlock` method or its usage within `getBlockExpression` altered the criteria for foldability, it could lead to incorrect handling of syntax patterns, such as those in issue 925. The test failures, which involve incorrect transformations of conditional expressions, suggest that the logic for identifying and folding these blocks might have been affected, aligning with the hypothesis of a recent change causing the issue."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.isFoldableExpressBlock(Node),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class that incorrectly handles specific JavaScript syntax patterns, leading to unexpected transformations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `isFoldableExpressBlock(Node)` checks if a node is a block containing a single expression statement, which is relevant to hypothesis H2. If recent changes in the optimization logic altered how blocks with single expressions are identified or handled, it could lead to incorrect transformations, as seen in the test failures. The method's focus on specific node structures suggests that any modification in its logic could directly impact how certain JavaScript syntax patterns are optimized, supporting the hypothesis that the test failure is due to recent changes in handling these patterns."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryRemoveRepeatedStatements(Node),0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by an incorrect optimization transformation in the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax pass that mishandles specific JavaScript syntax patterns related to issue 925.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `tryRemoveRepeatedStatements(Node n)` is designed to optimize JavaScript code by removing duplicate statements from IF blocks. It specifically targets scenarios where the same statement appears in both branches of an IF-ELSE structure, allowing for code simplification. This method supports Hypothesis H3, as it directly manipulates the structure of IF statements, which could lead to incorrect transformations if not handled properly. In the failure context, the transformation of IF statements into ternary expressions might be mishandled, particularly when dealing with complex expressions like `x[--y]`, which could be incorrectly optimized by this method, leading to the observed discrepancies in the test results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax(boolean),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax(boolean)` is a constructor that initializes the `late` flag, which determines the aggressiveness of the optimization process. Since it does not invoke any other methods or contain logic beyond setting this flag, it neither directly supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1. The test failure is more likely related to the logic within other methods of the class that handle syntax transformations, rather than the constructor itself."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.tryReplaceUndefined(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `tryReplaceUndefined(Node)` focuses on replacing ""undefined"" with ""void 0"" and does not directly interact with or modify the syntax patterns related to conditional expressions or increment/decrement operations, which are central to the test failures in issue 925. Since the method does not handle or optimize the specific syntax patterns involved in the test cases, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1. The test failures are more likely related to other parts of the optimization logic in the `PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax` class that deal with conditional expressions and increment/decrement operations."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax.isReturnExpressBlock(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the optimization logic of the PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax class, which incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns related to issue 925.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeSubstituteAlternateSyntax (HH1),"The method `isReturnExpressBlock(Node)` checks if a node is a block with a single return statement containing an expression. This method does not directly interact with or modify the optimization logic that transforms conditional statements into ternary expressions, as seen in the test failures. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1 directly, since it does not influence the handling of syntax patterns related to issue 925. The test failures are more likely related to changes in the logic that processes conditional expressions, which this method does not address."
