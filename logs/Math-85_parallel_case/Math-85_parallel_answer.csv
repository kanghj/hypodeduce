In the context of the failure in `testMath280`, the method's role in bracketing a root does not directly address precision errors in the cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculation. Instead, it focuses on finding a valid interval for root-finding algorithms. The failure due to a `ConvergenceException` with extreme bounds and a high maximum iteration count indicates that the issue may not be directly related to the precision of the CDF but rather to the inability to converge within the given constraints, which could indirectly support the hypothesis if the extreme input values lead to such convergence issues."
"org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket(UnivariateRealFunction,double,double,double,int)",0.708632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testMath280"" could be due to a precision error in the calculation of the cumulative distribution function for extreme input values.",org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils.bracket` is designed to find an interval that brackets a root of a function by expanding from an initial value within specified bounds and iterations. In the context of the failure in `testMath280`, the method's role in bracketing suggests that it is not directly responsible for precision errors in the cumulative distribution function (CDF) calculation. Instead, the failure is more likely due to the extreme input values causing convergence issues, as indicated by the large bounds and the immediate failure after one iteration, rather than a precision error in the CDF itself. The method's input validation and bracketing logic do not inherently address precision errors in function evaluation, supporting the hypothesis that the issue lies elsewhere."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractDistribution.AbstractDistribution(),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testMath280"" could be due to incorrect assumptions about the precision or rounding behavior of floating-point arithmetic in the test assertions.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractDistribution (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.AbstractDistribution.AbstractDistribution()` is a default constructor and does not directly interact with floating-point arithmetic or precision handling. It simply initializes the distribution object without setting any specific parameters related to precision or rounding behavior. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not influence the precision or rounding behavior of floating-point arithmetic in the test assertions. The failure is more likely related to the implementation details of the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method or the test's expectations rather than the constructor itself."
org.apache.commons.math.MaxIterationsExceededException.MaxIterationsExceededException(int),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testMath280"" could be due to a precision error in the calculation of the cumulative distribution function for extreme input values.",org.apache.commons.math.MaxIterationsExceededException (HH1),"The method `MaxIterationsExceededException(int maxIterations)` constructs an exception indicating that the maximum number of iterations allowed has been exceeded. In the failure context of `testMath280`, the exception is thrown after only one iteration, despite the maximum being set to a very large number (2,147,483,647). This suggests that the failure is not due to reaching the iteration limit but rather due to an inability to converge within the given bounds. Therefore, the method supports the hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure could be related to precision issues in calculating the cumulative distribution function, as the algorithm fails to converge quickly, possibly due to extreme input values."
"org.apache.commons.math.ConvergenceException.ConvergenceException(String,Object[])",0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testMath280"" could be due to a precision error in the calculation of the cumulative distribution function for extreme input values.",org.apache.commons.math.ConvergenceException (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ConvergenceException.ConvergenceException(String,Object[])` constructs an exception with a formatted message, indicating a failure in convergence during a calculation. In the context of the failure in `testMath280`, the exception message details a convergence issue with extreme bounds and a high number of maximum iterations, which suggests that the method encountered difficulties in achieving the desired precision. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure could indeed be due to a precision error when calculating the cumulative distribution function for extreme input values, evidenced by the inability to converge within the specified bounds and iterations."
