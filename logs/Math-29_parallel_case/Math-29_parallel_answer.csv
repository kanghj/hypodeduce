org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.ebeDivide(RealVector),0.900000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the `SparseRealVector` implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.ebeDivide(RealVector)` supports Hypothesis H3. The method begins by checking vector dimensions to ensure compatibility, but it does not explicitly handle mixed numeric types, such as differentiating between integer and floating-point operations. This lack of explicit type handling could lead to unexpected results, such as dividing by zero without producing `NaN`, as seen in the test failure where `0.0 / 0.0` was expected to yield `NaN` but resulted in `0.0`. This suggests a potential type mismatch or incorrect handling of numeric types during division."
"org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[],double)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[], double)` initializes a vector from an array of doubles and uses an epsilon to determine which values should be stored. This suggests that the method is designed to handle floating-point precision issues, which could support hypothesis H1 if the epsilon is not appropriately handling zero values or mixed numeric types, leading to unexpected results like storing zeros instead of NaN. The failure in the test, where a division by zero results in `0.0` instead of `NaN`, indicates a potential issue in how zero values are processed or stored, aligning with the hypothesis of incorrect handling of mixed numeric types."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.ebeMultiply(RealVector),0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `ebeMultiply(RealVector v)` in `OpenMapRealVector` checks vector dimensions and performs element-by-element multiplication, which suggests it handles numeric types consistently within its operations. The failure in `testEbeDivideMixedTypes` indicates an expectation of `NaN` when dividing by zero, but the result was `0.0`, suggesting a potential issue in handling zero values rather than a type mismatch. The method's dimension check implies that type mismatches are unlikely, as it ensures compatibility before proceeding with operations."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntry(int),0.300000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the `SparseRealVector` implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntry(int)` supports hypothesis H3 by ensuring that the index is valid before retrieving a value, but it does not directly address type mismatches or mixed numeric types. The method retrieves values from the `entries` map, which implies that any type mismatch or incorrect handling would occur elsewhere, possibly during the storage or computation of these values. The failure in the test suggests that the issue might arise from how zero values are handled during division, as indicated by the unexpected result of `0.0` instead of `NaN` when dividing by zero."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.isDefaultValue(double),0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `isDefaultValue(double value)` checks if a given value is effectively zero by comparing its absolute value to a small epsilon. This method supports hypothesis H1, as it suggests that the SparseRealVector implementation might treat very small values as zero, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when dividing by or multiplying with such values. In the context of the test failure, if a zero or near-zero value is involved in the division or multiplication, it could result in a type mismatch or incorrect handling, such as returning 0.0 instead of NaN when dividing by zero."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[]),0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[])` constructs a vector using an array of doubles, which suggests that it expects homogeneous numeric types (i.e., all elements are doubles). This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure could be due to the method not handling mixed numeric types properly during element-by-element operations. If the input array contains mixed types or unexpected values (e.g., `0.0`), the method might not correctly handle these during operations like division, leading to discrepancies such as expecting `NaN` but getting `0.0`."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(OpenMapRealVector),0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(OpenMapRealVector)` is a copy constructor that initializes a new vector by copying the size, entries, and epsilon from an existing `OpenMapRealVector`. This method does not directly handle numeric operations or type conversions, so it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1 regarding type mismatches during element-by-element division. The failure in the test likely arises from the division operation itself, not from the vector initialization or copying process."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntries(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntries()` returns the internal `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`, which stores non-zero entries of the vector. This method supports hypothesis H1, as it suggests that the vector only explicitly manages non-zero entries, potentially leading to issues when handling zero values during operations like division. If the division operation does not correctly handle zero entries or mixed numeric types, it could result in unexpected outcomes, such as returning 0.0 instead of NaN when dividing by zero, as seen in the test failure."
"org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.setEntry(int,double)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.setEntry(int, double)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it primarily handles setting a double value at a specified index in the vector, ensuring the index is valid and managing storage for non-default values. The failure in the test suggests an issue with handling `0.0` values during division, where `NaN` was expected. This indicates a potential problem in the division logic rather than in the `setEntry` method, which does not perform type checks or arithmetic operations that could lead to a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getDimension(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch or incorrect handling of mixed numeric types during element-by-element division in the SparseRealVector implementation.,org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getDimension()` returns the length of the vector, which does not directly relate to handling mixed numeric types or type mismatches during element-by-element operations. The failure in the test is due to an unexpected result (0.0 instead of NaN) when dividing elements, suggesting a potential issue in how zero values are handled during division, rather than a problem with vector dimensions. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not involve type handling or arithmetic operations."
