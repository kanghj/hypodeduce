org.mockito.exceptions.verification.SmartNullPointerException.SmartNullPointerException(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method signature or parameter types that the test relies on, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual parameter values in the exception message.",org.mockito.exceptions.verification.SmartNullPointerException (HH1),"The method `SmartNullPointerException.SmartNullPointerException(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the exception message is directly set through the constructor's `message` parameter. If there was a recent change in the method signature or parameter types that the test relies on, it could lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual parameter values in the exception message. Since the test expects the message to include ""oompa, lumpa,"" any discrepancy in how these parameters are passed or formatted in the message could result in the observed failure. The constructor does not modify the message, so any changes in parameter handling upstream would directly affect the message content."
