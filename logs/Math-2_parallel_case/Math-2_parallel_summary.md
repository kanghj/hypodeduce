## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.HypergeometricDistribution(int,int,int)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testMath1021" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `HypergeometricDistribution(int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)` constructs a hypergeometric distribution using the specified parameters: population size (N), number of successes in the population (m), a...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.HypergeometricDistribution(RandomGenerator,int,int,int)** — score 0.808. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testMath1021" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `HypergeometricDistribution(RandomGenerator rng, int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)` is designed to initialize a hypergeometric distribution with specified parameters: `populationSize`, `numberOfSuccess...

3. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSupportLowerBound()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testMath1021" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `getSupportLowerBound()` calculates the lower bound of the support for the hypergeometric distribution as `max(0, n + m - N)`. Given the test parameters `N = 43130568`, `m = 42976365`, and `n = 50`, the calculation becomes `ma...

4. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSupportUpperBound()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to edge cases not being handled properly in the test. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `getSupportUpperBound()` returns the minimum of the number of successes `m` and the sample size `n`, which in this case is `min(42976365, 50) = 50`. This supports Hypothesis H4 because the test expects samples to be between 0 ...

5. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.calculateNumericalVariance()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure in "testMath1021" could be due to incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `calculateNumericalVariance()` computes the variance of the hypergeometric distribution using the parameters `N`, `m`, and `n`, which are the population size, number of successes, and sample size, respectively. The failure in ...

6. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumericalMean()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H5: Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `getNumericalMean()` computes the mean of the hypergeometric distribution using the formula `n * m / N`, where `n` is the sample size, `m` is the number of successes, and `N` is the population size. In the test case, these val...

7. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumericalVariance()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H5: Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `getNumericalVariance()` calculates the variance of the hypergeometric distribution, which is crucial for understanding the spread of the distribution's outcomes. If the variance calculation is incorrect due to invalid assumpt...

8. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumberOfSuccesses()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure in "testMath1021" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the HypergeometricDistribution implementation, such as when the sample size is greater than the population size. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `getNumberOfSuccesses()` returns the value of the field `numberOfSuccesses`, which corresponds to the parameter `m` in the test. In the test `testMath1021`, `m` is set to 42976365, which is less than the population size `N` (4...

9. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getPopulationSize()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testMath1021" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getPopulationSize()` simply returns the value of the `populationSize` field, which is set during the construction of the `HypergeometricDistribution` object. In...

10. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSampleSize()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testMath1021" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSampleSize()` returns the value of the field `sampleSize`, which corresponds to the parameter `n` passed to the constructor of `HypergeometricDistribution`. ...
