"org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.HypergeometricDistribution(int,int,int)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMath1021"" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `HypergeometricDistribution(int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)` constructs a hypergeometric distribution using the specified parameters: population size (N), number of successes in the population (m), and sample size (n). In the test `testMath1021`, these parameters are set as N = 43130568, m = 42976365, and n = 50. The failure, where a sample value of -50 is observed, suggests that the parameters might not be correctly validating or handling edge cases, such as when the number of successes (m) is very close to the population size (N), potentially leading to unexpected negative sample values. This supports hypothesis H1, indicating that incorrect or extreme parameter values could cause the unexpected behavior."
"org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.HypergeometricDistribution(RandomGenerator,int,int,int)",0.807927,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMath1021"" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `HypergeometricDistribution(RandomGenerator rng, int populationSize, int numberOfSuccesses, int sampleSize)` is designed to initialize a hypergeometric distribution with specified parameters: `populationSize`, `numberOfSuccesses`, and `sampleSize`. In the test `testMath1021`, the parameters passed are `N = 43130568`, `m = 42976365`, and `n = 50`. The failure, where a sample of `-50` is observed, suggests that the parameters might not be correctly set or validated, as the method should ensure that the number of successes (`m`) and sample size (`n`) are within valid ranges relative to the population size (`N`). The method's documentation indicates it throws exceptions for invalid parameters, but the test does not handle these, supporting the hypothesis that incorrect parameter values could lead to unexpected behavior."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSupportLowerBound(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMath1021"" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `getSupportLowerBound()` calculates the lower bound of the support for the hypergeometric distribution as `max(0, n + m - N)`. Given the test parameters `N = 43130568`, `m = 42976365`, and `n = 50`, the calculation becomes `max(0, 50 + 42976365 - 43130568)`, which results in `max(0, -149153)`, yielding a lower bound of `0`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method correctly returns `0`, indicating that the failure is not due to an incorrect lower bound calculation, but potentially due to other parameter-related issues or implementation errors in the sampling process."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSupportUpperBound(),0.800000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to edge cases not being handled properly in the test.,org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `getSupportUpperBound()` returns the minimum of the number of successes `m` and the sample size `n`, which in this case is `min(42976365, 50) = 50`. This supports Hypothesis H4 because the test expects samples to be between 0 and `n` (50), but the failure indicates a sample of `-50`, which suggests that the distribution might not be handling edge cases correctly. The negative sample value contradicts the expected behavior, indicating a potential issue with how the distribution parameters are being used or interpreted, leading to incorrect assumptions about the valid range of sample values."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.calculateNumericalVariance(),0.300000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""testMath1021"" could be due to incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `calculateNumericalVariance()` computes the variance of the hypergeometric distribution using the parameters `N`, `m`, and `n`, which are the population size, number of successes, and sample size, respectively. The failure in ""testMath1021"" suggests that the sample value is negative, which is unexpected. This could indicate that the distribution parameters are not being handled correctly, especially in edge cases, leading to incorrect probability calculations. Since the variance calculation relies on these parameters, any incorrect assumptions or miscalculations in their values could contribute to the observed failure, supporting hypothesis H3."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumericalMean(),0.300000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases.,org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `getNumericalMean()` computes the mean of the hypergeometric distribution using the formula `n * m / N`, where `n` is the sample size, `m` is the number of successes, and `N` is the population size. In the test case, these values are `n = 50`, `m = 42976365`, and `N = 43130568`. The mean calculation does not directly address edge cases where the sample size `n` is much smaller than `m` or `N`, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the distribution's behavior. This supports Hypothesis H5, as the failure (sample = -50) suggests that the distribution's edge case handling might be flawed, possibly due to incorrect parameter assumptions affecting probability calculations."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumericalVariance(),0.300000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by incorrect assumptions about the distribution parameters leading to an invalid calculation of probabilities in edge cases.,org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `getNumericalVariance()` calculates the variance of the hypergeometric distribution, which is crucial for understanding the spread of the distribution's outcomes. If the variance calculation is incorrect due to invalid assumptions about the distribution parameters (e.g., N, m, n), it could lead to incorrect probability calculations, especially in edge cases. In the test, the sample value of -50 suggests a potential issue with parameter assumptions or variance calculation, supporting Hypothesis H5 that incorrect assumptions about parameters might lead to invalid probability calculations."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getNumberOfSuccesses(),0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testMath1021"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the HypergeometricDistribution implementation, such as when the sample size is greater than the population size.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `getNumberOfSuccesses()` returns the value of the field `numberOfSuccesses`, which corresponds to the parameter `m` in the test. In the test `testMath1021`, `m` is set to 42976365, which is less than the population size `N` (43130568), so the method itself does not directly support hypothesis H2. The failure, indicated by a negative sample value, suggests an issue elsewhere, possibly in the sampling logic, rather than in handling the edge case where the sample size exceeds the population size. The method's behavior does not directly relate to the hypothesis since it does not involve sample size logic."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getPopulationSize(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMath1021"" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getPopulationSize()` simply returns the value of the `populationSize` field, which is set during the construction of the `HypergeometricDistribution` object. In the test `testMath1021`, the population size `N` is correctly passed as 43130568, which matches the expected parameter for the constructor. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve any logic that could alter or validate the correctness of the parameter values; it merely retrieves the value that was initially provided."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSampleSize(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMath1021"" may be caused by incorrect parameter values being passed to the HypergeometricDistribution constructor, leading to unexpected behavior or results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution.getSampleSize()` returns the value of the field `sampleSize`, which corresponds to the parameter `n` passed to the constructor of `HypergeometricDistribution`. In the test `testMath1021`, `n` is set to 50, which is a valid parameter for the sample size. Since the method simply returns this value without modification, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure, where a sample of -50 is observed, suggests an issue elsewhere, possibly in the sampling logic or parameter validation, rather than in the `getSampleSize()` method itself."
