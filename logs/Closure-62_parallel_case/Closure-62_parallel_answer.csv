"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.format(JSError,boolean)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of a line, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.format(JSError, boolean)` supports Hypothesis H1 because it constructs the error message by including a source excerpt and a visual indicator (caret) at the error position. If there was a recent change in how trailing spaces are handled, it could affect the alignment of the caret, leading to the unexpected formatting results observed in the test failure. The method's reliance on precise character positioning for the caret suggests that any alteration in handling spaces could directly impact the test outcome."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of a line, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider)` initializes the formatter with a `SourceExcerptProvider` and defaults the excerpt type to `LINE`. This suggests that the formatter's behavior is influenced by how the `SourceExcerptProvider` handles line excerpts. If a recent change affected how trailing spaces are managed in the `SourceExcerptProvider` or the default excerpt type, it could lead to unexpected formatting results, supporting hypothesis H1. The test failure indicates a discrepancy in expected versus actual output, which could be due to such a change affecting line handling, including trailing spaces."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider,SourceExcerpt)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of a line, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `LightweightMessageFormatter.LightweightMessageFormatter(SourceExcerptProvider, SourceExcerpt)` initializes the formatter with a `SourceExcerptProvider` and a `SourceExcerpt`, ensuring that the source is not null and setting the excerpt field. This constructor does not directly handle formatting logic or trailing spaces, which suggests that the failure in `testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1` is unlikely to be caused by changes in this constructor. Instead, the issue might reside in other parts of the `LightweightMessageFormatter` class that deal with formatting logic, as this constructor only sets up the necessary components without altering formatting behavior."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter$LineNumberingFormatter.formatLine(String,int)",0.300000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of whitespace characters at the end of a line, leading to unexpected formatting results in the error message output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter$LineNumberingFormatter.formatLine(String,int)` supports hypothesis H5 because it returns the input line unchanged, which means it does not handle or modify whitespace characters at the end of a line. This lack of processing could lead to unexpected formatting results if the error message output relies on specific handling of trailing whitespace. Since the method does not alter the line, any trailing spaces remain, potentially causing discrepancies in the expected versus actual output in the test results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.formatError(JSError),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testFormatErrorSpaceEndOfLine1"" may be failing due to a recent change in the LightweightMessageFormatter class that incorrectly handles trailing spaces at the end of a line, leading to unexpected formatting results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.LightweightMessageFormatter.formatError(JSError)` itself does not directly handle trailing spaces, as it simply delegates the task to the `format(JSError, boolean)` method with the `warning` flag set to false. The hypothesis H1 suggests that the failure might be due to a recent change in how trailing spaces are handled, but since `formatError` is merely an entry point, any issues with trailing spaces would likely originate from the `format(JSError, boolean)` method. Therefore, the hypothesis is neither directly supported nor contradicted by the `formatError` method alone, as it does not provide insight into the handling of trailing spaces."
