The failure occurs because the test expects integer values, but the method's return type is a float, indicating a type mismatch rather than an issue with parsing logic for newer Java version formats."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionAsInt(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionAsInt()` supports Hypothesis H1 because it relies on parsing logic that converts a version string to an integer. The failure occurs when `SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt(null)` returns `0.0` instead of `0`, indicating that the parsing logic might not correctly handle `null` or empty strings, which could extend to newer Java version formats. The call flow involves `toJavaVersionIntArray` parsing the version string into an array, and `toVersionInt` converting this array to an integer, suggesting that any inadequacies in handling unexpected or new version formats could lead to test failures."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.toVersionInt(int[]),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.toVersionInt(int[])` supports Hypothesis H1 as it returns `0` when the input array `javaVersions` is `null`, which aligns with the expected behavior for handling `null` inputs. However, the test failure indicates a mismatch between expected and actual values (`0` vs. `0.0`), suggesting that the parsing logic might incorrectly handle certain Java version formats, potentially converting them to floating-point numbers instead of integers. This discrepancy implies that the method might not fully accommodate newer Java version formats, leading to the observed test failure."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.toJavaVersionIntArray(String,int)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `toJavaVersionIntArray(String version, int limit)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it returns an empty integer array when the input version string is `null`, which might not be correctly handled by the `toJavaVersionInt` method, leading to the test failure. The test expects a return value of `0` for a `null` input, but the conversion to an integer might be incorrectly interpreting the empty array as `0.0`, causing the assertion failure. This suggests that the parsing logic does not correctly handle `null` inputs, which aligns with the hypothesis that newer or unexpected Java version formats are not being parsed correctly."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionAsFloat(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionAsFloat()` supports Hypothesis H1 by indicating that the parsing logic might be flawed. The method relies on `toJavaVersionIntArray` to parse the version string, which suggests that if this parsing logic does not correctly handle certain Java version formats, it could lead to incorrect conversion results. The test failure, where `null` input results in `0.0` instead of `0`, implies that the parsing logic might not correctly handle edge cases or newer Java version formats, leading to discrepancies in expected versus actual results."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.toVersionFloat(int[]),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.toVersionFloat(int[])` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its conversion logic. It constructs a string from an integer array representing a Java version and parses it as a float, which can lead to unexpected float values like `0.0` instead of `0` when handling null or empty inputs. This behavior aligns with the test failure where `assertEquals(0, SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt(null))` expected `0` but received `0.0`, indicating a mismatch in handling certain Java version formats."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionMatches(String),0.300000,H3,0.800000,"Hypothesis H3: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect or outdated mapping of Java version strings to integer values, which does not account for the latest Java version format.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionMatches(String)` checks if the current Java version starts with a specified prefix, which does not directly relate to converting Java version strings to integer values. This method's functionality focuses on matching version prefixes rather than mapping them to integers, thus it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3. The failure in `testJavaVersionAsInt` is likely due to the conversion logic in `SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt`, which is not addressed by `getJavaVersionMatches`."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionTrimmed(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getJavaVersionTrimmed()` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to incorrect parsing logic. It returns the Java version string starting with a digit, which might not handle newer Java version formats correctly if they include non-digit prefixes or unexpected structures. Since the test failure indicates a mismatch between expected and actual values (e.g., `0` vs. `0.0`), this suggests that the trimming logic might not adequately prepare the version string for conversion to an integer, leading to parsing errors in `SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt()`."
org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getSystemProperty(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.getSystemProperty(String)` retrieves system properties and returns null if a `SecurityException` occurs, but it does not directly handle or parse Java version strings. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the failure in `testJavaVersionAsInt` is related to parsing logic, not property retrieval. The test failure indicates a parsing issue where the expected integer value is compared to a floating-point result, suggesting that the parsing logic in `SystemUtils.toJavaVersionInt` might not correctly handle certain Java version formats, but this is unrelated to the `getSystemProperty` method."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.isJavaVersionMatch(String,String)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtilsTest::testJavaVersionAsInt"" may be failing due to an incorrect parsing logic that does not handle certain Java version formats introduced in newer Java releases.",org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.SystemUtils.isJavaVersionMatch(String,String)` checks if a Java version string starts with a specified prefix, which suggests it is primarily used for simple prefix matching rather than detailed parsing of version formats. This method does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve parsing logic that could misinterpret newer Java version formats. The failure in `testJavaVersionAsInt` is due to an unexpected output format (e.g., returning `0.0` instead of `0`), which is unrelated to the prefix-checking functionality of `isJavaVersionMatch`."
