"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendWeekyear(int,int)",0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the transition between week-based year boundaries, leading to an off-by-one error in parsing dates that fall on the boundary weeks.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `appendWeekyear(int minDigits, int maxDigits)` supports Hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the off-by-one error in parsing dates at week-based year boundaries. This method appends a numeric weekyear field, which is crucial in determining the correct year for dates that fall on boundary weeks. If the parsing logic does not correctly handle the transition between week-based years, it could lead to an incorrect interpretation of the weekyear, as seen in the test failure where ""2012-01-01"" was parsed as ""2011-01-03"". The method's reliance on `appendSignedDecimal` suggests that any misalignment in the expected weekyear format or boundary handling could result in such errors."
org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.append0(Object),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.append0(Object)` appends elements to the formatter, affecting both printing and parsing. It does not directly handle specific date calculations or logic for weekyear and month combinations. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure is more likely related to how the `DateTimeFormatter` interprets the pattern ""xxxx-MM-ww"" rather than the behavior of `append0`, which simply adds elements to the formatter without altering parsing logic."
org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendWeekOfWeekyear(int),0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the transition between week-based year boundaries, leading to an off-by-one error in parsing dates that fall on the boundary weeks.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `appendWeekOfWeekyear(int minDigits)` in `DateTimeFormatterBuilder` supports Hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the off-by-one error in parsing dates at week-based year boundaries. It appends a numeric `weekOfWeekyear` field, which could misinterpret the week number when transitioning between years, especially if the week-based year differs from the calendar year. In the test case, the formatter pattern ""xxxx-MM-ww"" uses this method, and the discrepancy between expected `<2012-01-02>` and actual `<2011-01-03>` suggests a misalignment in week-year calculation, aligning with the hypothesis of boundary transition mishandling."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendYear(int,int)",0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the transition between week-based year boundaries, leading to an off-by-one error in parsing dates that fall on the boundary weeks.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendYear(int, int)` appends a numeric year field to the formatter, which is crucial in parsing week-based year patterns like ""xxxx-MM-ww"". This method's reliance on `appendSignedDecimal(DateTimeFieldType, int, int)` suggests it handles numeric values directly, without additional logic for week-based year transitions. Therefore, it neither directly supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3, as it does not inherently address the complexities of week-year boundaries, potentially leading to off-by-one errors when parsing dates at these boundaries."
org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.toFormatter(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.toFormatter()` constructs a `DateTimeFormatter` by evaluating the appended elements to determine if they support parsing. It does not directly handle the logic for parsing specific date components like weekyear or month. Instead, it relies on the underlying formatter logic to interpret the pattern ""xxxx-MM-ww"". If the pattern is misinterpreted due to incorrect handling of weekyear and month, the formatter constructed by `toFormatter()` would propagate this issue, supporting hypothesis H1. The failure in parsing ""2012-01-01"" as ""2011-01-03"" suggests a misalignment in interpreting the weekyear, which `toFormatter()` itself does not correct or influence directly."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder$NumberFormatter.parseInto(DateTimeParserBucket,String,int)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",,"The method `parseInto` in `DateTimeFormatterBuilder$NumberFormatter` parses numeric values from a string and stores them in a `DateTimeParserBucket`, which is used to build the final date. If the parsing logic incorrectly interprets the ""xxxx-MM-ww"" pattern, it could miscalculate the weekyear, leading to the observed test failure. Specifically, the method's handling of the weekyear (xxxx) and week (ww) might not align with the expected date calculation, resulting in the incorrect date of ""2011-01-03"" instead of ""2012-01-02"" for the input ""2012-01-01""."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder$Composite.parseInto(DateTimeParserBucket,String,int)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",,"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder$Composite.parseInto(DateTimeParserBucket, String, int)` supports Hypothesis H2 by iterating through the parsers to parse the input string based on the composite formatter's pattern. In this case, the pattern ""xxxx-MM-ww"" is used, where ""xxxx"" represents the weekyear, ""MM"" the month, and ""ww"" the week of the weekyear. The failure occurs because the parsing logic may incorrectly interpret the combination of weekyear and month, leading to an unexpected date calculation, as evidenced by the test expecting ""2012-01-02"" but receiving ""2011-01-03"". This suggests that the method's handling of the weekyear and month combination could indeed be flawed, resulting in the incorrect date parsing."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder$Composite.decompose(List,List,List)",0.400000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the transition between week-based year boundaries, leading to an off-by-one error in parsing dates that fall on the boundary weeks.",,"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder$Composite.decompose(List,List,List)` processes element pairs by adding printers and parsers to lists, which suggests it plays a role in how date components are interpreted and formatted. If the method incorrectly handles the transition between week-based year boundaries, it could lead to an off-by-one error, as seen in the test failure where ""2012-01-01"" was parsed as ""2011-01-03"". The method's handling of composites through `addArrayToList(List,Object[])` might not correctly account for the nuances of week-based year transitions, supporting Hypothesis H3."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.append0(DateTimePrinter,DateTimeParser)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.append0(DateTimePrinter, DateTimeParser)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination. When this method appends the printer and parser, it may not correctly account for the nuances of week-based year calculations, especially when transitioning between years, as seen in the test case where ""2012-01-01"" is parsed as ""2011-01-03"". The invalidation of the cached formatter suggests that any misalignment in the parsing logic could lead to discrepancies in date calculations, supporting the hypothesis that the issue lies in the parsing logic for weekyear and month combinations."
"org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendDecimal(DateTimeFieldType,int,int)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the weekyear and month combination in the parsing logic, leading to an invalid date calculation for the year 2012.",org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appendDecimal(DateTimeFieldType, int, int)` primarily deals with formatting numeric fields, such as ensuring the correct number of digits are used, and does not directly handle the logic for interpreting weekyear and month combinations. The failure in the test is likely due to the parsing logic of the pattern ""xxxx-MM-ww"", which involves interpreting the weekyear and week number, rather than an issue with how numeric fields are appended. The method's role in formatting numbers does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not influence the semantic interpretation of weekyear and month combinations."
