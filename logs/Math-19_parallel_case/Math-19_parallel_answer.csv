If the boundary range exceeds the algorithm's expected limits, this method would likely detect such discrepancies, potentially leading to exceptions like `NumberIsTooLargeException`. However, the test failure indicates a `MathIllegalStateException` due to a NaN parameter, suggesting that while boundary checks are in place, the handling of NaN values might not be adequately addressed, contradicting the hypothesis that boundary range alone is the cause of the failure."

If `checkParameters()` fails to validate these boundaries correctly, it could lead to unexpected states during optimization, potentially causing exceptions like `MathIllegalStateException` when encountering NaN values or other illegal states. The failure in the test suggests that the optimizer's handling of boundary conditions might not be robust, aligning with the hypothesis that boundary range issues could lead to incorrect behavior or exceptions."

Since it calls a deprecated constructor, it may rely on legacy behavior that doesn't adequately address boundary constraints, potentially leading to exceptions like `NumberIsTooLargeException`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the failure could stem from the optimizer not managing boundary ranges exceeding expected limits, resulting in incorrect optimization behavior or unexpected exceptions."

Since it calls the main constructor with a default convergence checker, it suggests that boundary handling is integral to its initialization. If the boundary range exceeds expected limits, as hypothesized in H1, the optimizer might not handle these constraints properly, leading to exceptions like `NumberIsTooLargeException`. However, the test failure due to `MathIllegalStateException` indicates that the optimizer might not be reaching the boundary check stage, possibly due to an earlier state-related issue, thus partially contradicting H1."

If these parameters are not correctly initialized or exceed expected limits, it could lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions during optimization. The failure context suggests that the optimizer might not handle boundary conditions properly, as indicated by the `MathIllegalStateException` when encountering NaN values, which supports Hypothesis H1 that the optimizer's handling of boundary ranges might be flawed."

Since the method denormalizes input variables based on boundaries, if these boundaries are improperly handled or exceed expected limits, it could lead to incorrect denormalization. This misalignment might cause the optimizer to operate on unexpected values, resulting in exceptions like `MathIllegalStateException` when the fitness function encounters unexpected NaN values, as seen in the test failure."

The method checks if `boundaries` is `null` and returns the original variables `x` without normalization, which suggests that if boundaries are not set or improperly defined, the optimizer might not correctly handle cases where the boundary range exceeds expected limits. This could lead to incorrect optimization behavior or exceptions, as seen in the test where an unexpected `MathIllegalStateException` is thrown instead of the expected `NumberIsTooLargeException`."

If the boundary range exceeds these limits, as hypothesized, it could lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions, such as the `MathIllegalStateException` observed in the test. The method's role in normalizing inputs indicates that exceeding expected limits might not be handled elsewhere, aligning with the hypothesis that boundary issues could cause failures."

The method includes logic for repairing points if boundaries are defined and a repair mode is active, suggesting that it expects inputs within certain limits. If the boundaries are exceeded and not properly repaired, this could lead to unexpected behavior or exceptions, such as the `MathIllegalStateException` observed in the test. The test failure indicates that the optimizer might not be handling boundary violations correctly, aligning with the hypothesis that exceeding expected limits can cause incorrect optimization behavior."

This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's lack of explicit boundary range validation could lead to scenarios where the optimizer encounters unexpected parameter values, potentially causing exceptions like `NumberIsTooLargeException` or `MathIllegalStateException`. The failure in the test suggests that the optimizer might not be robust against boundary conditions exceeding its expected operational limits, aligning with the hypothesis."
