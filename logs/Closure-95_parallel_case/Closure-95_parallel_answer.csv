"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitCall(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" may be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic for qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitCall(NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" through its role in type inference and validation for function calls. Specifically, the method retrieves the type of the function being called (`childType`) and checks if it can be called, which implies it plays a part in determining the expected types for function parameters. If the type inference logic for qualified names is incorrect or incomplete, it could lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual parameter types, as seen in the test failure where a boolean is passed instead of a number."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitParameterList(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType)",0.800000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling or inference of qualified names within nested or complex JavaScript object structures during type checking.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitParameterList` processes the parameters of a function call, iterating over the arguments and comparing them against the expected types defined in the `FunctionType`. In the failure context, the method would be responsible for checking the type of the actual parameter passed to `ns.foo`, which is a boolean, against the expected type, a number. This supports Hypothesis H4, as the method's role in type checking involves handling qualified names like `ns.foo` and ensuring that the types match, indicating that any incorrect handling or inference of these names could lead to the observed failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling or inference of qualified names within nested or complex JavaScript object structures during type checking.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H4 by handling type checking through a switch statement that processes different types of parse tree nodes, including those representing qualified names. In the failure context, the method likely processes the assignment of `ns.foo` and the subsequent call `ns.foo(true)`, where it should infer the type of `ns.foo` correctly. If the method incorrectly handles the qualified name `ns.foo` within the nested function structure, it could lead to the type mismatch error observed, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling or inference of qualified names in complex object structures."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.TypedScopeCreator(AbstractCompiler,CodingConvention)",0.700000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator (HH4),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.TypedScopeCreator(AbstractCompiler,CodingConvention)` initializes key components such as the compiler, coding convention, and type registry, which are crucial for type inference and checking. If there was a recent change in how these components interact, particularly in handling qualified names, it could lead to incorrect type resolutions as seen in the test failure. The constructor itself does not directly handle type inference but sets up the environment where such inference occurs, supporting the hypothesis that changes in this setup might affect type handling."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.attachLiteralTypes(Node),0.700000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling or inference of qualified names within nested or complex JavaScript object structures during type checking.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator (HH4),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.attachLiteralTypes(Node)` supports Hypothesis H4 by ensuring that literal nodes are assigned the correct native types during type checking. In the failure context, the method would correctly assign the type `boolean` to the literal `true`, which is then used in the type inference process. However, the error arises because the method does not directly handle the inference of qualified names within nested structures, such as `ns.foo`, which is where the mismatch between the expected `number` and provided `boolean` occurs. This suggests that while `attachLiteralTypes` correctly assigns types to literals, it does not address the inference of qualified names, supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of such names."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.createInitialScope(Node),0.700000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator (HH4),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.createInitialScope(Node)` supports hypothesis H5 by establishing the foundational type environment, including native JavaScript types and values, which are crucial for type inference. If there was a recent change in how qualified names are handled during this initialization, it could lead to incorrect type resolutions, as seen in the test failure where a boolean is incorrectly passed to a function expecting a number. The method's role in setting up the initial scope means any changes here could directly impact type inference outcomes, particularly with qualified names."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.getPrototypePropertyOwner(Node),0.700000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference algorithm that incorrectly handles qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator (HH4),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.getPrototypePropertyOwner(Node)` supports hypothesis H5 by potentially contributing to the failure if it incorrectly identifies or fails to identify the owner of a prototype property due to recent changes in handling qualified names. If the method returns an incorrect owner or null when it should not, it could lead to improper type inference for the `ns.foo` function, causing the mismatch between expected and actual parameter types. The failure context indicates a type mismatch, which aligns with the hypothesis that changes in qualified name handling might be responsible."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.createScope(Node,Scope)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" may be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic for qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator (HH4),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypedScopeCreator.createScope(Node, Scope)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" through its role in type inference. This method is responsible for creating a scope that includes all declared types and properties, which means any incorrect or incomplete handling of type declarations or properties within this method could lead to the type mismatch observed in the test. If the method fails to accurately register or infer the type of `ns.foo` as accepting only numbers, it could result in the erroneous acceptance of a boolean, thus supporting the hypothesis of incorrect type inference logic for qualified names."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node,boolean)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" may be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic for qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node, boolean)` supports hypothesis H1 by performing type checking on nodes, which includes traversing the abstract syntax tree (AST) to resolve types. In the failure context, the method likely traverses the AST where `ns.foo` is defined and called, and it should infer the type of the parameter `x` as `number`. However, the error indicates a mismatch when `ns.foo` is called with a `boolean`, suggesting that the type inference logic for the qualified name `ns.foo` might be incorrect or incomplete, as it fails to enforce the expected type constraint. This aligns with the hypothesis that the failure is due to issues in type inference for qualified names."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.processForTesting(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testQualifiedNameInference5"" may be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic for qualified names, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual type resolutions.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.processForTesting(Node, Node)` initializes the type checking process by setting up the scope and processing the JavaScript code. It supports Hypothesis H1 because it is responsible for establishing the environment in which type inference occurs, including handling qualified names. If there is an issue in how this method sets up or processes the scope, it could lead to incorrect type inference, resulting in the mismatch observed in the test failure. The method's role in initializing type checks suggests that any flaws in its logic could directly impact the accuracy of type inference for qualified names."
