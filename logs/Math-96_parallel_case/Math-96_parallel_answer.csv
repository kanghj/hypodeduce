org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.multiply(Complex),0.900000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" might be due to incorrect handling of edge cases involving complex numbers with zero imaginary parts.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.multiply(Complex)` implements the multiplication of two complex numbers using the formula \((a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i\). In the test case, the multiplication of \((0 + 1i)\) and \((-1 + 0i)\) should result in \((0 - 1i)\), which matches the expected result. However, the failure suggests a mismatch in the actual result, indicating that the method might not correctly handle edge cases involving zero imaginary parts, supporting Hypothesis H4. The method's checks for NaN and infinity do not directly address this edge case, potentially leading to the observed discrepancy."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.equals(Object),0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases involving complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.equals(Object)` supports Hypothesis H2 by ensuring that two `Complex` objects are considered equal only if both their real and imaginary parts are exactly the same, and neither part is `Double.NaN`. In the failure context, the test expects the result of multiplying `new Complex(0,1)` by `new Complex(-1,0)` to be `new Complex(0,-1)`, but the assertion fails, indicating that the resulting complex number does not match the expected value. This suggests that the multiplication operation might not correctly handle edge cases involving zero real or imaginary parts, leading to an incorrect result that fails the equality check."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.Complex(double,double)",0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases involving complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.Complex(double, double)` initializes a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts without any special handling for edge cases, such as zero values. In the failure context, the test expects the result of multiplying `new Complex(0, 1)` by `new Complex(-1, 0)` to be `new Complex(0, -1)`, but the assertion fails, suggesting that the multiplication logic might not correctly handle cases where the real or imaginary parts are zero. This supports Hypothesis H2, as the constructor itself does not address edge cases, potentially leading to incorrect results when such cases are not properly managed elsewhere in the code."
org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.hash(double),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases involving complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.",org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtils.hash(double)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H2, as it deals with generating a hash code for a double value and does not involve any logic specific to handling complex numbers or their edge cases. The failure in `testMath221` is related to the multiplication of complex numbers, specifically involving zero real or imaginary parts, which is not influenced by how double values are hashed. The hash method's functionality of converting a double to a long and then generating a hash code does not impact the arithmetic operations or edge case handling in complex number operations."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.createComplex(double,double)",0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the complex number division operation, leading to inaccurate results when handling edge cases such as division by zero or very small numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.createComplex(double, double)` is responsible for creating a new complex number instance given the real and imaginary parts. It does not perform any operations related to division or multiplication of complex numbers. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the failure in `testMath221` is related to the multiplication operation, not the creation of complex numbers. The method simply returns a new `Complex` object and does not influence the arithmetic operations that might lead to the failure described in the hypothesis."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.isNaN(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the complex number division operation, leading to inaccurate results when handling edge cases such as division by zero or very small numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.isNaN()` checks if either the real or imaginary part of a complex number is NaN, which is unrelated to the multiplication operation in the test failure. The test failure in `testMath221` involves a multiplication operation, not division, and the expected and actual results differ in sign, not due to NaN values. Therefore, `isNaN()` does not support hypothesis H1, as it does not address division operations or edge cases like division by zero."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.hashCode(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the complex number division operation, leading to inaccurate results when handling edge cases such as division by zero or very small numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.hashCode()` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1, which concerns the division operation. The failure in `testMath221` involves the multiplication of complex numbers, not division, and the hash code method is used for object identity and not for arithmetic operations. The hash code computation, which involves the real and imaginary parts, does not affect the arithmetic logic of multiplication or division, and thus does not support or contradict hypothesis H1 regarding division inaccuracies."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.getReal(),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221"" might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases involving complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.getReal()` returns the real part of a complex number and does not involve any operations that could directly affect the multiplication logic or handling of edge cases involving zero real or imaginary parts. Since the failure in `testMath221` involves the multiplication of complex numbers, the `getReal()` method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not participate in the multiplication process or handle edge cases directly. The issue is more likely related to the multiplication logic itself rather than the retrieval of the real part."
