org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution.isSupportLowerBoundInclusive(),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the FDistribution class that incorrectly calculates the support lower bound, leading to an unexpected result in the test.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution (HH1),"The method `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` in the `FDistribution` class always returns `true`, which contradicts hypothesis H1. The test expects the method to return `false` when the lower bound is infinite or when the density at the lower bound is NaN or infinite. Since the method unconditionally returns `true`, it does not account for these conditions, leading to the assertion failure. This suggests that the issue is not due to a recent change in calculating the support lower bound but rather the method's implementation not aligning with the test's expectations."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.density(double),0.300000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method calculating the support lower bound, which now incorrectly excludes the lower bound value due to a logic error or incorrect condition check.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.density(double)` computes the probability density for a given value `x` within the bounds of a uniform distribution. If `x` is outside the interval `[lower, upper]`, it returns `0.0`; otherwise, it returns the constant density `1/(upper - lower)`. This behavior supports Hypothesis H4 because if the method calculating the support lower bound incorrectly excludes the lower bound due to a logic error, the density method would return `0.0` for the lower bound, contradicting the expected behavior of returning a non-zero density. This discrepancy could lead to the assertion failure observed in the test, where the density at the lower bound should be non-NaN and non-infinite if the lower bound is correctly included."

It does not directly calculate or affect the support lower bound logic, as it only sets up the distribution parameters. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4 directly, as it does not involve any logic that would exclude the lower bound value. The issue likely lies elsewhere, possibly in the logic that checks or uses these bounds, rather than in the constructor itself."

If a recent change in this method or its delegate (`UniformRealDistribution(double, double, double)`) introduced a logic error, it could incorrectly exclude the lower bound by miscalculating or misinterpreting the bounds. This aligns with Hypothesis H4, as the failure in the test could stem from such a change, leading to the assertion failure where the expected inclusion of the lower bound does not match the actual behavior."

This method does not directly calculate the support lower bound; instead, it sets up the distribution parameters. Therefore, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H4, as it does not involve logic for determining inclusivity of the lower bound. The issue likely lies elsewhere, possibly in the logic that evaluates the density at the lower bound or in the method `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()`, which checks the conditions for inclusivity."

The failure in the test is concerned with the lower bound's inclusivity and its density calculation, which is not influenced by the `getSupportUpperBound()` method. Since `getSupportUpperBound()` only returns the value of the ""upper"" field without affecting or interacting with the lower bound calculations, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1."

This behavior is consistent and does not directly relate to the hypothesis H1 regarding the `FDistribution` class. The failure in the test for `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` suggests an issue with how the lower bound is handled in `FDistribution`, potentially due to a recent change. Since `isSupportUpperBoundInclusive()` is unrelated to the lower bound logic and consistently returns `false`, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1."
