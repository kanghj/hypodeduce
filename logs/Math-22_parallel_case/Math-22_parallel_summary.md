## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution.isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the FDistribution class that incorrectly calculates the support lower bound, leading to an unexpected result in the test. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.FDistribution (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `isSupportLowerBoundInclusive()` in the `FDistribution` class always returns `true`, which contradicts hypothesis H1. The test expects the method to return `false` when the lower bound is infinite or when the density at the lo...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.density(double)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method calculating the support lower bound, which now incorrectly excludes the lower bound value due to a logic error or incorrect condition check. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.density(double)` computes the probability density for a given value `x` within the bounds of a uniform distribution. If `x` is outside the interval `[lower, upper]...

3. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(RandomGenerator,double,double,double)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method calculating the support lower bound, which now incorrectly excludes the lower bound value due to a logic error or incorrect condition check. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(RandomGenerator, double, double, double)` initializes a uniform distribution by validating that the lower bound is less than the upper bound and setting the corresponding fields...

4. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(double,double)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method calculating the support lower bound, which now incorrectly excludes the lower bound value due to a logic error or incorrect condition check. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(double, double)` constructs a distribution with specified lower and upper bounds, which suggests it directly influences the calculation of the support lower bound. If a recent c...

5. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(double,double,double)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the method calculating the support lower bound, which now incorrectly excludes the lower bound value due to a logic error or incorrect condition check. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `UniformRealDistribution.UniformRealDistribution(double, double, double)` constructs a distribution with specified bounds and delegates to another constructor with a default random generator. This method does not directly calc...

6. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.getSupportUpperBound()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the FDistribution class that incorrectly calculates the support lower bound, leading to an unexpected result in the test. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.getSupportUpperBound()` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1, as it deals with the upper bound of the support, not the lower bound. The failure in the test is concern...

7. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution.isSupportUpperBoundInclusive()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the FDistribution class that incorrectly calculates the support lower bound, leading to an unexpected result in the test. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.UniformRealDistribution (HH5).
    Explanation: The method `isSupportUpperBoundInclusive()` in the `UniformRealDistribution` class always returns `false`, indicating that the upper bound is not inclusive. This behavior is consistent and does not directly relate to the hypothesis H1 re...
