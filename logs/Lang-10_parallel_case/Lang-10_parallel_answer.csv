"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.parse(String,ParsePosition)",0.810000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the date parsing logic that does not correctly handle specific edge cases or locale-specific date formats.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.parse(String, ParsePosition)` uses a `Matcher` to process the input string based on a predefined pattern. If the pattern or the logic handling the `Matcher` was recently altered, it could lead to incorrect parsing, especially for edge cases or locale-specific formats like ""3  Tue"". The failure in the test case, where the expected result is `null` but the actual result is a parsed date, suggests that the method might not correctly handle the input format ""M E"", supporting Hypothesis H3 that a recent change could have introduced this parsing issue."
org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.parse(String),0.808632,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the date parsing logic that does not correctly handle specific edge cases or locale-specific date formats.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.parse(String)` attempts to parse a date from a given string, returning `null` if parsing fails. In the failure context, the test expects a `null` result but receives a valid date, indicating that the parsing logic incorrectly interprets the input ""3  Tue"" as a valid date. This behavior supports Hypothesis H3, suggesting that recent changes in the parsing logic might not correctly handle edge cases or locale-specific formats, as evidenced by the unexpected parsing of ""3  Tue"" into a specific date."
org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat.parse(String),0.806842,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the date parsing logic that does not correctly handle specific edge cases or locale-specific date formats.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat.parse(String)` delegates the parsing task to an internal `parser` object, which suggests that any recent changes in the underlying `parser` logic could affect how dates are parsed. The failure in the test case `testLANG_831`, where the expected result was `null` but the actual result was a parsed date, indicates that the parser might not be handling the format ""M E"" correctly, potentially due to changes in handling specific edge cases or locale-specific formats. This supports Hypothesis H3, as the discrepancy in expected versus actual results could stem from recent modifications in the date parsing logic."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FormatCache.getInstance(String,TimeZone,Locale)",0.700000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual date format patterns due to recent changes in locale-specific date formatting rules.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FormatCache (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FormatCache.getInstance(String, TimeZone, Locale)` supports Hypothesis H5 as it directly involves creating a date/time formatter based on a specified pattern, time zone, and locale. If there have been recent changes in locale-specific date formatting rules, this method could produce a formatter that interprets the pattern differently than expected, leading to discrepancies like the one observed in the test failure. The failure in `testLANG_831` suggests that the formatter created might not align with the expected format due to such locale changes, resulting in a mismatch between the expected `null` and the actual parsed date."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.FastDateParser(String,TimeZone,Locale)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat_ParserTest::testLANG_831"" may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual date format patterns due to recent changes in locale or time zone handling within the FastDateFormat class.",org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.FastDateParser(String, TimeZone, Locale)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in initializing the date format pattern, time zone, and locale. If there were recent changes in how locales or time zones are handled, this constructor could lead to discrepancies between expected and actual parsed dates. Specifically, the constructor's reliance on the `init` method to set up parsing strategies might not align with the expected format ""M E"" for the input ""3  Tue"", resulting in the observed mismatch."
org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.init(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat_ParserTest::testLANG_831"" may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual date format patterns due to recent changes in locale or time zone handling within the FastDateFormat class.",org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser.init()` supports Hypothesis H1 by directly influencing how date patterns are interpreted and parsed based on locale and timezone. It initializes parsing strategies using the provided pattern, locale, and timezone, which means any recent changes in these areas could lead to discrepancies between expected and actual date formats. The failure in `testLANG_831` could be due to a mismatch in how the pattern ""M E"" is parsed, potentially affected by changes in locale or timezone handling, as the method constructs regex patterns and parsing strategies that are sensitive to these factors."
org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.parsePattern(),0.700000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual date format patterns due to recent changes in locale-specific date formatting rules.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.parsePattern()` processes a date format pattern and returns a list of rules based on the locale-specific symbols, such as ERAs, months, and weekdays. This method supports Hypothesis H4 because it relies on `DateFormatSymbols`, which are locale-dependent. If there have been recent changes in locale-specific date formatting rules, the rules generated by `parsePattern()` might not match the expected format, leading to discrepancies like the one observed in the test failure. The mismatch between the expected `null` and the actual parsed date suggests that the pattern ""M E"" might not be interpreted as intended due to such locale changes."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter.parseToken(String,int[])",0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the date parsing logic that does not correctly handle specific edge cases or locale-specific date formats.,org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDatePrinter (HH5),"The method `parseToken(String pattern, int[] indexRef)` is responsible for parsing tokens from a date pattern, which suggests it plays a role in interpreting date formats. Given the failure context, where the test expects a null result but receives a parsed date, it indicates that the method might not correctly handle specific patterns like ""M E"" or locale-specific formats. If recent changes affected how tokens are parsed, particularly for edge cases or locale-specific patterns, this could support Hypothesis H3, as the method's logic directly influences how date strings are interpreted and parsed."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser$NumberStrategy.setCalendar(FastDateParser,Calendar,String)",0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the date parsing logic that does not correctly handle specific edge cases or locale-specific date formats.,,"The method `setCalendar` in `FastDateParser$NumberStrategy` directly modifies a calendar field by parsing an integer from the provided string value. This method supports Hypothesis H3 as it suggests that any recent changes in how the string value is parsed or modified could lead to incorrect date handling, especially if the string does not conform to expected formats or if locale-specific nuances are not properly addressed. The failure in the test case, where the expected date is `null` but the parsed date is `Mon Mar 02 21:00:00 PST 1970`, indicates a potential mishandling of the input ""3  Tue"", possibly due to such changes in parsing logic."
"org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser$TextStrategy.addRegex(FastDateParser,StringBuilder)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateFormat_ParserTest::testLANG_831"" may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual date format patterns due to recent changes in locale or time zone handling within the FastDateFormat class.",,"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.time.FastDateParser$TextStrategy.addRegex` appends regex patterns based on display names for a given field, which suggests it is responsible for generating regex patterns that match date components like day names. If recent changes in locale or time zone handling affected how display names are retrieved or formatted, this could lead to a mismatch between expected and actual patterns, supporting Hypothesis H1. The failure in `testLANG_831` indicates a discrepancy between expected and parsed dates, which could be due to such mismatches in regex patterns generated by `addRegex`."
