com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.tryFoldExpr(Node),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `tryFoldExpr(Node)` attempts to simplify expression result nodes by removing operations and expressions deemed unnecessary. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's purpose is to eliminate what it considers ""useless"" operations, which could mistakenly include function calls like `Math.sin(0)` if they are incorrectly assumed to have no side effects. The failure in `testCall1` indicates that `Math.sin(0)` was removed, suggesting that `tryFoldExpr(Node)` might have incorrectly identified it as a side-effect-free operation, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect assumptions about side effects."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.tryOptimizeBlock(Node),0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.tryOptimizeBlock(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by focusing on removing unnecessary block nodes and their children only if they are deemed to have no side effects. The failure in `testCall1` could be due to the method incorrectly identifying the `Math.sin(0)` call as having no side effects, thus removing it when it should have been retained. The method's reliance on side effect checks aligns with the hypothesis that an incorrect assumption about side effects might lead to the erroneous removal of code."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.trySimpilifyUnusedResult(Node),0.806842,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `trySimpilifyUnusedResult(Node n)` is designed to remove nodes that are deemed unnecessary, which aligns with the hypothesis H1 that the failure might be due to incorrect assumptions about side effects. In the context of `testCall1`, the method could mistakenly identify `Math.sin(0)` as having no side effects and thus remove it, leading to the discrepancy between expected and actual results. The method's behavior of returning `null` for nodes considered ""not useful"" supports the hypothesis that the function call was incorrectly simplified or removed."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.optimizeSubtree(Node),0.804526,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `optimizeSubtree(Node)` in `PeepholeRemoveDeadCode` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially removing function calls that are incorrectly assumed to have no side effects. The method dispatches optimization based on node types and includes folding and optimization methods like `tryFoldExpr`, which might incorrectly optimize away expressions like `Math.sin(0)` if it assumes they have no side effects. This aligns with the failure context where the expected result was an empty output, but the actual result retained the `Math.sin(0)` call, indicating that the optimization might have incorrectly removed or retained code based on incorrect assumptions about side effects."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.trySimpilifyUnusedResult(Node,boolean)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `trySimpilifyUnusedResult` is designed to remove or replace nodes in the AST that are deemed unnecessary, based on the `removeUnused` parameter. In the context of the failure in `testCall1`, if the method incorrectly identifies the `Math.sin(0)` call as having no side effects and thus removes it, this would support Hypothesis H1. The method's behavior of potentially removing nodes without side effects aligns with the hypothesis that the failure might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.isSimpleAssignment(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.isSimpleAssignment(Node)` evaluates whether a node is a simple assignment or a variable declaration with initialization, which is unrelated to function calls like `Math.sin(0)`. This method does not assess side effects of function calls, thus it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in ""testCall1"" likely stems from a different part of the code that incorrectly assumes `Math.sin(0)` has no side effects, leading to its erroneous removal."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode.tryOptimizeConditionalAfterAssign(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testCall1"" might be due to an incorrect assumption about the side effects of function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeRemoveDeadCode (HH1),"The method `tryOptimizeConditionalAfterAssign(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 because it attempts to optimize code by replacing conditions with constant values after simple assignments, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about the side effects of function calls. If the method incorrectly identifies a function call like `Math.sin(0)` as having no side effects and removes it, this could result in the observed failure in `testCall1`. The method's reliance on `isSimpleAssignment` and similar checks might not adequately account for the side effects of such function calls, leading to the removal of code that should be retained."
