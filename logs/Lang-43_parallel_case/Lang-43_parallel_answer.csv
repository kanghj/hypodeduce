"org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.ExtendedMessageFormat(String,Locale,Map)",0.810000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest::testEscapedQuote_LANG_477"" may be caused by incorrect handling or parsing of escaped quotes within the message format, leading to unexpected output or exceptions.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.ExtendedMessageFormat(String, Locale, Map)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it involves parsing the pattern string, which includes handling escaped quotes. The method calls `applyPattern`, where the parsing logic is executed, potentially mishandling the escaped quotes in the pattern ""it''s a {0,lower} 'test'!"", leading to excessive memory usage and the `OutOfMemoryError`. The stack trace indicates that the error occurs during string operations, suggesting that the handling of escaped quotes might be causing an infinite loop or excessive memory allocation."
"org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.ExtendedMessageFormat(String,Map)",0.806615,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest::testEscapedQuote_LANG_477"" may be caused by incorrect handling or parsing of escaped quotes within the message format, leading to unexpected output or exceptions.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.ExtendedMessageFormat(String, Map)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly involves parsing the provided pattern, which includes escaped quotes. The failure occurs when the pattern `""it''s a {0,lower} 'test'!""` is processed, suggesting that the handling of escaped quotes (`''`) might be incorrect, potentially causing an infinite loop or excessive memory allocation. The constructor's reliance on parsing logic that interprets these quotes could lead to the observed `OutOfMemoryError`, aligning with the hypothesis that the issue stems from improper handling of escaped quotes."

If `escapingOn` is true, the method should correctly process escaped quotes, which supports hypothesis H1 by suggesting that incorrect handling of escaped quotes could lead to unexpected behavior, such as an infinite loop or excessive memory usage. The failure in `testEscapedQuote_LANG_477` could be due to improper parsing logic in `appendQuotedString`, especially if the method fails to correctly identify and handle escaped quotes, leading to excessive memory allocation and the observed `OutOfMemoryError`."
org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.applyPattern(String),0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest::testEscapedQuote_LANG_477"" may be caused by incorrect handling or parsing of escaped quotes within the message format, leading to unexpected output or exceptions.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.applyPattern(String)` supports Hypothesis H1. The method begins by checking if the `registry` is null, and if so, it delegates to `super.applyPattern(pattern)`. This suggests that the handling of the pattern, including escaped quotes, relies on the superclass's implementation when the registry is null. If the superclass does not correctly handle escaped quotes, it could lead to issues such as unexpected output or exceptions, aligning with the hypothesis that incorrect parsing of escaped quotes may cause the failure observed in the test."
org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.next(ParsePosition),0.100000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormatTest::testEscapedQuote_LANG_477"" may be caused by incorrect handling or parsing of escaped quotes within the message format, leading to unexpected output or exceptions.",org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.text.ExtendedMessageFormat.next(ParsePosition)` simply advances the parse position by one index and returns the updated position. This method does not directly handle or parse escaped quotes; it only modifies the position index. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any logic related to the parsing or handling of escaped quotes within the message format. The issue is more likely related to other parts of the code that handle string parsing or formatting."
