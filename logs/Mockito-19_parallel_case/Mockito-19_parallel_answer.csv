org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.tryPropertyOrFieldInjection(),0.800000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The test failure might be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming conflict or incorrect setter method signature.,,"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.tryPropertyOrFieldInjection()` supports hypothesis H4 by attempting to resolve mock injection through property or field injection, which could be affected by naming conflicts or incorrect setter method signatures. If the mock object `candidate1` is not correctly injected due to such conflicts, the method's strategy of adding `PropertyAndSetterInjection` to the chain might fail to resolve the correct field, leading to the observed test failure. The failure at `assertNull(otherSuperUnderTesting.candidate1)` suggests that the mock was incorrectly injected into `candidate2` instead, indicating a potential misconfiguration in the test setup."
"org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection.onFields(Set,Object)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature.,org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection (HH5),"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection.onFields(Set, Object)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the misconfiguration in the test setup. This method is responsible for configuring mock injections based on the provided fields and target instance. If the fields set or the target instance is incorrectly specified, such as having a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature, it could lead to improper injection of mocks. The test failure, where `candidate1` is unexpectedly not null, suggests that the mock was injected into the wrong field, possibly due to these configuration issues."
org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.apply(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature.,,"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.apply()` supports Hypothesis H1 by indicating that the test failure could be due to a misconfiguration in the test setup. The method iterates over each field and applies injection strategies, which suggests that if there is a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature, the mock object might not be injected correctly. The failure at `assertNull(otherSuperUnderTesting.candidate1)` implies that `candidate1` was unexpectedly initialized, possibly due to incorrect processing by the injection strategies, aligning with the hypothesis of a misconfiguration."
org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.withMocks(Set),0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature.,,"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.withMocks(Set)` supports Hypothesis H1 by indicating that the test failure could be due to a misconfiguration in the test setup. This method adds a set of mocks to the `OngoingMockInjection` instance, which suggests that if the mocks are not correctly configured or named, they might not be injected properly. The failure at `assertNull(otherSuperUnderTesting.candidate1)` implies that `candidate1` was unexpectedly injected, possibly due to a naming mismatch or incorrect method signature, aligning with the hypothesis of misconfiguration."
org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.tryConstructorInjection(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature.,,"The method `tryConstructorInjection()` supports Hypothesis H1 as it configures the injection strategy to attempt constructor injection, which could lead to a failure if the constructor parameters do not match the expected mock object names or types. If the constructor injection is prioritized over other strategies and there is a mismatch in naming or parameter types, it could result in the mock object not being injected correctly, leading to the observed test failure. The method's role in adding `ConstructorInjection` to the strategy chain suggests that any misalignment in constructor expectations could cause the mock injection to fail, aligning with the hypothesis of a misconfiguration."
org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.handleSpyAnnotation(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test setup where the mock object is not being correctly injected due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature.,,"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.MockInjection$OngoingMockInjection.handleSpyAnnotation()` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to a misconfiguration in the test setup. If the `@Spy` annotations are not correctly handled due to a naming mismatch or incorrect setter method signature, the `SpyOnInjectedFieldsHandler` might not properly inject the spy objects into the fields. This could lead to the observed test failure where `candidate1` is unexpectedly not null, indicating that the mock or spy was not injected as intended. The method's role in configuring the post-injection strategy suggests that any misalignment in the setup could disrupt the expected injection process."
