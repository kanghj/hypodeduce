org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(double),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testExtremeValues"" may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling extreme values in the normal distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `cumulativeProbability(double x)` in `NormalDistributionImpl` calculates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) using the error function `Erf.erf`, which in turn relies on the `Gamma.regularizedGammaP` method. The failure context indicates a `MaxIterationsExceededException` in `Gamma.regularizedGammaP`, suggesting that the algorithm fails to converge for extreme values of `x`. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure occurs when handling extreme values, potentially due to numerical instability or precision loss in the computation of the error function for large deviations from the mean."
"org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.NormalDistributionImpl(double,double)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testExtremeValues"" may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling extreme values in the normal distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `NormalDistributionImpl.NormalDistributionImpl(double, double)` initializes the normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation by invoking `setMean(double)` and `setStandardDeviation(double)`. This supports hypothesis H1 because the constructor itself does not directly handle calculations but sets up parameters that influence subsequent computations. The failure in `testExtremeValues` occurs during the calculation of cumulative probabilities for extreme values, suggesting that the issue likely arises from numerical instability or precision loss in these calculations, rather than from the initialization process itself."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.setStandardDeviation(double),0.200000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of floating-point precision limits when computing probabilities for extreme values in the normal distribution.,org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `setStandardDeviation(double)` supports Hypothesis H4 indirectly by ensuring that the standard deviation is positive, which is crucial for the correct computation of probabilities in a normal distribution. However, it does not directly address floating-point precision issues, as it only validates the input and does not involve any calculations that could lead to precision errors. The failure in `cumulativeProbability` suggests that the issue likely lies in the computation of probabilities for extreme values, rather than in setting the standard deviation itself."
org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.setMean(double),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testExtremeValues"" may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling extreme values in the normal distribution calculations.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.setMean(double)` simply assigns the provided mean value to an internal field without performing any calculations or calling other methods. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve any numerical computations that could lead to instability or precision loss. The failure in the test is more likely related to the calculations within `cumulativeProbability`, which involve complex mathematical functions like `Gamma.regularizedGammaP` and `Erf.erf`, rather than the setting of the mean itself."
