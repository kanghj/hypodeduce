(confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionAnalyzer.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` primarily focuses on analyzing AST nodes to identify side effects and manage local variable tainting. It does not directly...

7. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionAnalyzer.visitCall(FunctionInformation,Node)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testLocalValue1" might be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the expected behavior of the NodeUtil class, leading to discrepancies in how local values are evaluated during the test. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionAnalyzer.visitCall(FunctionInformation, Node)` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially altering how call sites are evaluated, which could affect the determination of l...

8. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionInformation.mayHaveSideEffects()** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H5: Hypothesis H5: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testLocalValue1" might be due to a recent change in the NodeUtil class that inadvertently altered the behavior of local value determination logic. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionInformation.mayHaveSideEffects()` returns true if a function is not marked as pure, indicating that the function may have side effects. This method supports hypothes...

9. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionAnalyzer.exitScope(NodeTraversal)** — score 0.600. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testLocalValue1" might be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the expected behavior of the NodeUtil class, leading to discrepancies in how local values are evaluated during the test. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PureFunctionIdentifier$FunctionAnalyzer.exitScope(NodeTraversal)` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially altering how local values are evaluated due to its role in managing local variable tainting ...
