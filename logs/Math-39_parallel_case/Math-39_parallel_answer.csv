"org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator(String,double,double,double,double)",0.800000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the stability limits of the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator(String, double, double, double, double)` supports hypothesis H4. It initializes the integrator with step size bounds, where the minimum step size is set to 0 and the maximum to `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`. This configuration allows the initial step size to be excessively large, potentially exceeding the stability limits of the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator. The call to `setStepSizeControl` with these bounds does not restrict the initial step size, which can lead to numerical instability, aligning with the hypothesis that an incorrect initial step size calculation is causing the failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.initializeStep(boolean,int,double[],double,double[],double[],double[],double[])",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the allowable range for the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability or overflow.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `initializeStep` in `AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator` is responsible for setting up the initial step size for the integration process. It takes into account parameters such as the direction of integration (`forward`), the order of the method, and scaling factors for the state vector. If the initial step size is incorrectly calculated, it could indeed exceed the allowable range, leading to the failure observed in the `testTooLargeFirstStep`. The test failure suggests that the initial step size might be too large, causing the computed derivatives to fall outside the expected range, which supports Hypothesis H1."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.resetInternalState(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the allowable range for the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability or overflow.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `resetInternalState()` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to an incorrect initial step size calculation. By setting the step size to the geometric mean of the minimal and maximal step sizes, it might inadvertently select a step size that is too large if the maximal step size is set to `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, as in the test setup. This could lead to numerical instability or overflow, causing the failure observed in the ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" test case. The method's behavior aligns with the hypothesis that an inappropriate step size calculation could be the root cause of the failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.sanityChecks(ExpandableStatefulODE,double)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the stability limits of the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.sanityChecks(ExpandableStatefulODE, double)` supports Hypothesis H4 by ensuring that the initial conditions and configurations are valid before integration begins. It performs checks on the dimension of the primary state and verifies that any vector tolerances match this dimension. If these checks fail, exceptions are thrown, which could prevent the integrator from proceeding with an incorrect initial step size. However, the method does not directly address the calculation of the initial step size itself, which means it does not contradict H4 but rather ensures that the setup is correct before any step size calculations are made."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.getMaxStep(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the allowable range for the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability or overflow.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.getMaxStep()` returns the maximal step size allowed by the integrator. In the test `testTooLargeFirstStep`, the integrator is initialized with a maximum step size of `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`, which means there is effectively no upper limit on the step size. This supports hypothesis H1, as the absence of a constraint on the step size could lead to an initial step size calculation that is too large, potentially causing numerical instability or overflow. The failure occurs because the test expects the step size to remain within a specific range, which is not enforced by the current configuration."
"org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.setStepSizeControl(double,double,double,double)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the allowable range for the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability or overflow.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `setStepSizeControl` in `AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator` allows setting the minimal and maximal step sizes, along with tolerance values, which directly influence the initial step size calculation. If these parameters are not set appropriately, the integrator may compute an initial step size that is too large, potentially causing the failure observed in `testTooLargeFirstStep`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's role in determining step size boundaries could lead to an incorrect initial step size if not configured correctly, resulting in numerical instability or overflow."
org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.getMinStep(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"" may be caused by an incorrect initial step size calculation that exceeds the allowable range for the Dormand-Prince 853 integrator, leading to numerical instability or overflow.",org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator.getMinStep()` returns the minimal step size allowed by the integrator. In the context of the failure in ""testTooLargeFirstStep"", if the initial step size calculated by the integrator exceeds this minimal step size, it could lead to numerical instability or overflow, supporting hypothesis H1. Since the test sets the minimal step size to 0, any positive initial step size would technically be valid, but if the step size is too large relative to the problem's scale (from 0.0 to 0.001), it could still cause issues, aligning with the hypothesis."
