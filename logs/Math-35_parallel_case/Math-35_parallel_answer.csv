"org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ElitisticListPopulation.ElitisticListPopulation(List,int,double)",0.910000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` not properly handling or validating a chromosome list with a size below the minimum required threshold, leading to an exception or incorrect behavior.",org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ElitisticListPopulation (HH1),"The method `ElitisticListPopulation.ElitisticListPopulation(List, int, double)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as the failure context indicates that the exceptions are related to the `elitismRate` parameter being out of the expected range (0.0 to 1.0), rather than the size of the chromosome list. The test cases provided (`testChromosomeListConstructorTooLow` and `testConstructorTooHigh`) both fail due to the `elitismRate` being outside the valid range, which triggers an `OutOfRangeException`. This suggests that the constructor is correctly validating the `elitismRate` but does not directly address any issues related to the size of the chromosome list."
"org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ElitisticListPopulation.ElitisticListPopulation(int,double)",0.908632,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect validation of the chromosome list size, allowing a population size that is too low to support the elitism rate specified.",org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ElitisticListPopulation (HH1),"The method `ElitisticListPopulation(int, double)` does not directly validate the chromosome list size; it only sets the population limit and elitism rate. The failure in the test cases is due to the `OutOfRangeException` not being thrown for elitism rates outside the valid range [0, 1]. This suggests that the method does not perform validation on the elitism rate, which contradicts Hypothesis H2, as the issue is not related to the chromosome list size but rather to the lack of validation for the elitism rate."
"org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulation.ListPopulation(List,int)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` not properly handling or validating a chromosome list with a size below the minimum required threshold, leading to an exception or incorrect behavior.",org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulation (HH2),"The method `ListPopulation(List<Chromosome> chromosomes, int populationLimit)` checks if the size of the chromosome list exceeds the population limit, throwing a `NumberIsTooLargeException` if it does. This behavior does not directly support Hypothesis H1, as the method does not validate whether the chromosome list size is below a minimum threshold; it only checks for exceeding the limit. The failure in the test case is more likely related to the handling of the `rate` parameter in the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which is not addressed by this method."
org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulation.ListPopulation(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by the constructor of `ElitisticListPopulation` not properly handling or validating a chromosome list with a size below the minimum required threshold, leading to an exception or incorrect behavior.",org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulation (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.genetics.ListPopulation.ListPopulation(int)` does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it focuses on validating the population limit rather than the size of the chromosome list. The constructor throws a `NotPositiveException` if the `populationLimit` is not positive, but it does not address the size of the chromosome list itself. The failure in the test cases is related to the `ElitisticListPopulation` constructor, which likely involves additional validation logic for the chromosome list and elitism rate, suggesting that the issue may lie in how these parameters are handled rather than the population limit validation."
