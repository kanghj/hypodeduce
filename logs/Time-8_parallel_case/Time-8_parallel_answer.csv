"org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(int,int)",0.900000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(int, int)` supports hypothesis H1 as it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when the minutes offset is out of the valid range, as seen in the test case `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(2, -15)`. This indicates that the method correctly handles edge cases by enforcing the constraint that the minutes value must be between 0 and 59, thus preventing the creation of a time zone with an invalid total offset. The failure in the test case is due to the invalid input of -15 minutes, which is outside the acceptable range, supporting the hypothesis that the method handles edge cases by validating input ranges."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forOffsetMillis(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forOffsetMillis(int)` supports Hypothesis H1 by enforcing strict bounds on the offset, ensuring it falls within the valid range of -23:59:59.999 to +23:59:59.999 milliseconds. This is similar to the behavior observed in `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(int, int)`, where an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown for invalid minute values, such as -15, indicating that both methods are designed to handle edge cases by validating input ranges. The consistent use of range checks in both methods suggests that the failure is likely due to incorrect handling of edge cases, as hypothesized."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.DateTimeZone(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.DateTimeZone(String)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it primarily sets the ID for the `DateTimeZone` and throws an exception if the ID is null. It does not handle or validate the offset hours and minutes directly. The failure in the test case is due to `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(2, -15)` throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` for minutes out of range, which indicates that the issue is with the validation logic in `forOffsetHoursMinutes`, not the constructor."
"org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.fixedOffsetZone(String,int)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.fixedOffsetZone(String,int)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that any fixed-offset `DateTimeZone` created is within the valid range for time zones. It does this by returning UTC for a zero offset and by caching or creating a new `FixedDateTimeZone` for non-zero offsets without exceeding valid ranges. The failure in the test case occurs because `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(2, -15)` attempts to create a time zone with an invalid negative minute offset, which is not handled by `fixedOffsetZone` since it assumes valid input."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forID(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that any provided time zone ID, including those representing offsets, is validated and parsed correctly. When an offset is specified, such as ""+23:59"" or ""+02:15"", the method parses these strings to create a `DateTimeZone` instance, ensuring that the offset is within the valid range. The failure context shows that an invalid offset, like ""-15"" minutes, triggers an `IllegalArgumentException`, indicating that the method correctly handles edge cases by enforcing valid offset ranges, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of edge cases."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forTimeZone(TimeZone),0.200000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.forTimeZone(TimeZone)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H2, as it deals with converting a `TimeZone` object to a `DateTimeZone`, rather than directly handling offset hours and minutes. However, it indirectly supports the hypothesis by ensuring that any `TimeZone` with a GMT offset is parsed and formatted correctly, which implies that the underlying system is capable of handling edge cases related to GMT offsets. The failure in the test case is due to an invalid negative minute value, which is unrelated to the handling of total offset ranges in `forTimeZone(TimeZone)`."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.offsetFormatter(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.offsetFormatter()` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 because it deals with formatting offset strings rather than validating the range of offset hours and minutes. The failure in the test is due to an `IllegalArgumentException` caused by passing an invalid minute value (-15) to `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes()`, which directly checks the validity of the input values. Since `offsetFormatter()` is only responsible for parsing and printing, it does not influence the validation logic that leads to the exception in the test case."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.parseOffset(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.parseOffset(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that string offsets are parsed into milliseconds within valid time zone ranges. It uses `offsetFormatter()` to interpret the string, which inherently checks for valid hour and minute values. In the failure context, `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes(2, -15)` throws an `IllegalArgumentException` due to invalid minutes, indicating that the method correctly handles edge cases by enforcing valid ranges, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of edge cases."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.getConvertedId(String),0.100000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zones.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.getConvertedId(String)` is unrelated to the handling of offset hours and minutes, as it focuses solely on converting old-style time zone IDs to new-style IDs using a static map. It does not interact with or validate the numeric values of offset hours and minutes, nor does it handle edge cases related to the total offset range. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not influence the validation logic for offset values in `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes`."
org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.getDefaultProvider(),0.100000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the offset hours and minutes result in a total offset that exceeds the valid range for time zone offsets.,org.joda.time.DateTimeZone (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.DateTimeZone.getDefaultProvider()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H3, as it is unrelated to the handling of edge cases for time zone offsets. This method is responsible for determining the default zone provider and does not interact with the logic that validates offset hours and minutes. The failure in the test is due to the `DateTimeZone.forOffsetHoursMinutes()` method throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid minute values, such as -15, which is unrelated to the provider selection process."
