## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry,Map)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testRecursiveRecord" may be caused by an infinite recursion issue within the RecordType implementation, leading to a stack overflow error during the test execution. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry, Map)` does not directly support the hypothesis H1 regarding infinite recursion leading to a stack overflow error. Instead, it initializes a record type by iterating over the provided prop...

2. **com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles recursive record types, leading to an infinite loop or stack overflow during type resolution. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `defineProperty` does not directly support hypothesis H2, as it primarily deals with adding properties to a record type and does not involve type inference logic or recursive type handling. The method checks if the type is fro...

3. **com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getImplicitPrototype()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testRecursiveRecord" may be caused by an infinite recursion issue within the RecordType implementation, leading to a stack overflow error during the test execution. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getImplicitPrototype()` does not support Hypothesis H1, as it simply retrieves the implicit prototype from the type registry without invoking any recursive operations or other met...
