"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry,Map)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testRecursiveRecord"" may be caused by an infinite recursion issue within the RecordType implementation, leading to a stack overflow error during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `RecordType.RecordType(JSTypeRegistry, Map)` does not directly support the hypothesis H1 regarding infinite recursion leading to a stack overflow error. Instead, it initializes a record type by iterating over the provided properties map and setting them up without any recursive calls. The failure in ""testRecursiveRecord"" is more likely related to how the `toAnnotationString()` method handles recursive references, as evidenced by the discrepancy in expected and actual output strings, rather than an issue within the constructor itself."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles recursive record types, leading to an infinite loop or stack overflow during type resolution.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `defineProperty` does not directly support hypothesis H2, as it primarily deals with adding properties to a record type and does not involve type inference logic or recursive type handling. The method checks if the type is frozen and adds non-inferred properties to a map, then calls the superclass's `defineProperty` method. Since it does not engage in type resolution or recursion, it is unlikely to contribute to an infinite loop or stack overflow related to recursive record types."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getImplicitPrototype(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testRecursiveRecord"" may be caused by an infinite recursion issue within the RecordType implementation, leading to a stack overflow error during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.RecordType.getImplicitPrototype()` does not support Hypothesis H1, as it simply retrieves the implicit prototype from the type registry without invoking any recursive operations or other methods that could lead to infinite recursion. The method's straightforward nature, focusing solely on fetching a native object type, suggests it is unlikely to contribute to a stack overflow error in the `testRecursiveRecord` test. The failure is more likely related to how the `toAnnotationString()` method handles recursive references, rather than the behavior of `getImplicitPrototype()`."
