"org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areEqual(Object,Object)",0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual equality logic for custom objects, possibly due to an incorrect implementation of the `equals` method in one of the objects being compared.",org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areEqual(Object,Object)` supports Hypothesis H3, as it attempts to determine equality by calling the `equals` method on the objects being compared. In the failure context, the `BadEquals` object likely has an incorrect or problematic implementation of the `equals` method, which causes a `RuntimeException` when `areEqual` is invoked. This suggests that the failure is indeed due to a mismatch in the expected and actual equality logic for custom objects, aligning with the hypothesis."

It iterates through each element of the arrays and calls `areEqual` for each corresponding pair, relying on the `equals` method of the objects being compared. In the failure context, the `BadEquals` object likely has an incorrect `equals` method implementation, causing the `areEqual` method to throw a `RuntimeException` when it attempts to compare `badequals` with itself. This indicates a mismatch in the expected and actual equality logic for custom objects, aligning with the hypothesis."
"org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areArraysEqual(Object,Object)",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the implementation of the `equals` method for the objects being compared, leading to incorrect equality evaluation.",org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areArraysEqual(Object, Object)` supports Hypothesis H2. The failure occurs when comparing an object of type `BadEquals` with itself, suggesting a potential issue with the `equals` method implementation. The method `areArraysEqual` checks array lengths and elements for equality, but if the `equals` method of `BadEquals` is flawed, it could lead to incorrect equality evaluation, as seen in the stack trace where `BadEquals.equals` is invoked and throws a `RuntimeException`. This indicates that the failure is likely due to the `equals` method's behavior rather than the array comparison logic itself."
"org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areArrayLengthsEqual(Object,Object)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the `equals` method implementation of the objects being compared, leading to incorrect equality checks.",org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.matchers.Equality.areArrayLengthsEqual(Object, Object)` checks if two arrays have the same length, which is unrelated to the `equals` method implementation of the objects being compared. The failure in the test occurs due to a `RuntimeException` thrown by the `equals` method of `BadEquals`, indicating that the issue is with the `equals` method itself rather than array length comparison. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with or affect the `equals` method logic."

The failure in the test occurs due to a `RuntimeException` thrown by the `equals` method of the `BadEquals` object, indicating that the issue is likely within the `equals` method itself rather than the array type checking. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with or affect the `equals` method logic."
