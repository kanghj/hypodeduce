This method does not directly handle null values, as it only deals with a boolean parameter. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3, which concerns discrepancies in handling null values. The failure in the test case is more likely related to the equality logic not accounting for changes in the `plotLines` state rather than null value handling."

This method focuses on creating an Icon based on provided parameters and does not involve any equality logic or null value handling. Since it does not interact with the fields or logic related to the `equals()` method, it does not provide evidence for or against the hypothesis that null value discrepancies cause the failure in equality checks."
