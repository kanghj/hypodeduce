The failure context indicates that the method throws a `MaxCountExceededException`, suggesting that the algorithm exceeded the maximum iteration count, which is a common symptom of cycling. The method's reliance on the `SimplexTableau` and iteration counter without explicit anti-cycling measures (e.g., Bland's Rule) can lead to infinite loops when encountering degenerate vertices, thus supporting the hypothesis."

The failure context indicates that the test `testMath828Cycle` resulted in a `MaxCountExceededException`, suggesting that the algorithm exceeded the maximum number of iterations allowed, which is consistent with cycling behavior. This implies that the method may not correctly handle degenerate vertices, leading to an infinite loop or cycling condition, as it fails to reach a feasible solution within the iteration limit."

The failure in ""testMath828Cycle"" is due to a `MaxCountExceededException`, indicating that the algorithm exceeded the maximum iteration count, potentially supporting H1. This suggests that the handling of degenerate vertices might be inadequate, as the specified parameters (epsilon and maxUlps) may not effectively prevent cycling, leading to an infinite loop."

If this method incorrectly handles ties or degenerate vertices, it could lead to repeated selection of the same pivot row, causing cycling or an infinite loop. In the context of the failure in ""testMath828Cycle,"" if the method fails to properly manage ties or degeneracy, it supports hypothesis H1 by potentially causing the algorithm to exceed the maximum iteration count due to cycling."

The test failure occurs due to exceeding the maximal iteration count, suggesting that the algorithm may be stuck in a loop, potentially caused by incorrect handling of degenerate vertices. The method's role in iterating over the Simplex tableau without resolving the cycling condition directly supports the hypothesis of an infinite loop due to degeneracy."

The failure in ""testMath828Cycle"" is due to exceeding this iteration count, as indicated by the `MaxCountExceededException`. This suggests that the solver might be stuck in a cycle, potentially supporting Hypothesis H5 that the failure could be due to incorrect handling of degenerate vertices, causing infinite cycling without reaching an optimal solution. The default initialization does not inherently address cycling issues, which aligns with the hypothesis."

It selects the pivot column based on the most negative coefficient in the objective function row, which can lead to revisiting the same vertices if the tableau is degenerate. In the context of the failure, if the tableau repeatedly selects the same pivot column due to multiple columns having similar negative values, it may cause the algorithm to cycle indefinitely, thus supporting the hypothesis that degenerate vertices are not handled correctly."
