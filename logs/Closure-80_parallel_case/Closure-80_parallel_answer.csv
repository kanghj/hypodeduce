com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.isBooleanResult(Node),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.isBooleanResult(Node)` uses `valueCheck` with `BOOLEAN_RESULT_PREDICATE` to determine if a node's evaluation always results in a boolean. If recent changes altered `BOOLEAN_RESULT_PREDICATE` or the logic within `valueCheck`, it could lead to incorrect evaluations, supporting hypothesis H1. The test failures, such as `assertTrue(NodeUtil.isBooleanResult(getNode(""true"")))`, suggest that the method might not be correctly identifying boolean results, indicating potential changes in the underlying logic."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.isBooleanResultHelper(Node),0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `isBooleanResultHelper(Node n)` checks if a node's type corresponds to a token that inherently results in a boolean value, such as `Token.TRUE`, `Token.FALSE`, or comparison tokens like `Token.EQ`. This method does not rely on other methods, suggesting that any recent changes affecting boolean result determination would likely involve modifications to the token type checks within this method. If the logic for identifying these tokens was altered, it could lead to incorrect evaluations, supporting Hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil$BooleanResultPredicate.apply(Node),0.806842,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",,"The method `NodeUtil$BooleanResultPredicate.apply(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly influences the outcome of `NodeUtil.isBooleanResult(Node)`, which is the focus of the failing test. If recent changes altered the logic within `isBooleanResultHelper(Node)`, which `apply(Node)` relies on, it could lead to incorrect evaluations of nodes like `""true""` or `""+true""`, causing the test failures observed. The test failures indicate that nodes expected to evaluate as non-boolean are being incorrectly identified, suggesting a potential flaw in the boolean evaluation logic."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.valueCheck(Node,Predicate)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.valueCheck(Node, Predicate)` recursively applies a predicate to nodes, specifically handling node types like ASSIGN, COMMA, AND, OR, and HOOK by traversing their children. This behavior suggests that if recent changes affected how these node types are processed, it could lead to incorrect boolean evaluations, supporting hypothesis H1. For instance, if the logic for handling a COMMA node was altered, it might incorrectly evaluate expressions like `getNode(""true"")`, which could explain the failure in `testIsBooleanResult`."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.isImmutableValue(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.isImmutableValue(Node)` primarily checks if a node represents an immutable value by evaluating specific node types and string values, such as NOT, VOID, NEG, and certain NAME nodes. This method does not directly determine if a node is a boolean result, as it focuses on immutability rather than boolean evaluation. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as the failure in `testIsBooleanResult` likely involves logic specific to boolean evaluation, which is not addressed by `isImmutableValue`."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.callHasLocalResult(Node),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"The test failure might be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations in the `NodeUtil` class.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.callHasLocalResult(Node)` checks if a CALL node has a local result by examining its side effect flags, which is unrelated to determining boolean results. This method does not interact with or alter the logic for evaluating boolean results, as it focuses solely on side effects of CALL nodes. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H2, as it does not influence the logic for boolean evaluations in the `NodeUtil` class."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.evaluatesToLocalValue(Node,Predicate)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.evaluatesToLocalValue(Node, Predicate)` determines if a node's value is local to the expression scope, which is unrelated to evaluating if a node represents a boolean result. The failure in `testIsBooleanResult` suggests issues with boolean evaluation logic, not local value determination. Therefore, changes in `evaluatesToLocalValue` are unlikely to directly affect the boolean result logic, contradicting hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.isSimpleOperator(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.isSimpleOperator(Node)` checks if a node represents a simple operator by invoking `isSimpleOperatorType(int)`. This method does not directly evaluate boolean results but rather determines if a node's type corresponds to a simple operator. If recent changes in the codebase affected the logic within `isSimpleOperatorType(int)`, it could indirectly influence the evaluation of nodes as boolean results, potentially supporting hypothesis H1. However, without specific changes to the boolean evaluation logic itself, the connection remains indirect."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.newHasLocalResult(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtilTest::testIsBooleanResult"" may be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.newHasLocalResult(Node)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1 because it focuses on determining if a node has a local result by checking if it only modifies the `this` context, rather than evaluating boolean results. The failure in `testIsBooleanResult` is related to the logic determining boolean evaluations, which is not directly influenced by the `newHasLocalResult` method, as it does not involve boolean logic or the specific nodes tested in `testIsBooleanResult`. Therefore, the recent changes affecting boolean result evaluations would not be reflected in the `newHasLocalResult` method's logic or call flows."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil.evaluatesToLocalValue(Node),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"The test failure might be caused by recent changes in the codebase that altered the logic determining boolean results, leading to incorrect evaluations in the `NodeUtil` class.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.NodeUtil (HH1),"The method `NodeUtil.evaluatesToLocalValue(Node)` returns whether a node is known to be a value not referenced elsewhere, which is unrelated to determining boolean results. The test failure in `testIsBooleanResult` suggests an issue with boolean evaluation logic, not local value evaluation. Therefore, changes in `evaluatesToLocalValue` are unlikely to directly affect boolean result evaluations, contradicting hypothesis H2."
