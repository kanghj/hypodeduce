This process is computationally intensive and can consume significant memory, especially with large matrices. In the context of the failure, the `OutOfMemoryError` suggests that the method's memory demands exceed available resources, supporting Hypothesis H2 by indicating that handling large datasets or high-degree polynomials may lead to resource exhaustion rather than numerical instability or precision errors."
org.apache.commons.math3.linear.EigenDecomposition.EigenDecomposition(RealMatrix),0.708632,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample"" could be due to numerical instability or precision errors when handling large datasets or high-degree polynomials.",org.apache.commons.math3.linear.EigenDecomposition (HH1),"The method `EigenDecomposition.EigenDecomposition(RealMatrix)` calculates the eigen decomposition of a given real matrix, which is a computationally intensive process that can be sensitive to numerical instability, especially with large matrices. In the context of the failure, the method's requirement for significant memory resources when handling large datasets or high-degree polynomials could lead to an `OutOfMemoryError`, as seen in the stack trace. This supports Hypothesis H2, as the failure could indeed be due to the method's inability to efficiently manage the large matrix sizes resulting from the polynomial fitting process, potentially exacerbating numerical instability or precision errors."
org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.CurveFitter.CurveFitter(DifferentiableMultivariateVectorOptimizer),0.300000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling large datasets in the polynomial fitting algorithm.,org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.CurveFitter (HH1),"The method `CurveFitter.CurveFitter(DifferentiableMultivariateVectorOptimizer)` is a simple constructor that initializes the `CurveFitter` with a specified optimizer. It does not directly handle data or perform computations, so it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4 regarding numerical instability or precision loss. The failure context indicates an `OutOfMemoryError`, suggesting that the issue is more likely related to memory management rather than numerical instability, as the constructor itself does not engage in operations that could cause precision loss."
org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer.setUp(),0.300000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling large datasets in the polynomial fitting algorithm.,org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer.setUp()` primarily initializes variables and resets counters, such as `jacobianEvaluations` and `weightMatrixSqrt`, which are not directly related to handling numerical instability or precision loss. The method does not involve operations on large datasets or numerical computations that could lead to instability or precision issues. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4, as it does not address the numerical handling aspects of the polynomial fitting algorithm."
org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer.squareRoot(RealMatrix),0.300000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample"" may be caused by numerical instability due to the handling of large datasets, leading to precision errors in polynomial coefficient calculations.",org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.general.AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer.squareRoot(RealMatrix)` computes the square root of a symmetric, positive-definite weight matrix using an `EigenDecomposition`. This process involves transforming the matrix to a tridiagonal form, which can be computationally intensive and memory-consuming, especially for large datasets. The failure in `PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample` due to an `OutOfMemoryError` suggests that the handling of large datasets may indeed lead to resource exhaustion, supporting hypothesis H1 that numerical instability and precision errors could arise from such intensive operations."
"org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.CurveFitter.addObservedPoint(double,double,double)",0.200000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample"" may be caused by numerical instability due to the handling of large datasets, leading to precision errors in polynomial coefficient calculations.",org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.CurveFitter (HH1),"The method `addObservedPoint(double weight, double x, double y)` in `CurveFitter` simply adds a weighted observed point to a collection without performing any calculations or transformations that could directly cause numerical instability. The failure in `PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample` is more likely due to memory constraints rather than numerical instability, as indicated by the `OutOfMemoryError`. The method itself does not handle large datasets or perform operations that could lead to precision errors, suggesting that the hypothesis H1 is not directly supported by this method's implementation."
