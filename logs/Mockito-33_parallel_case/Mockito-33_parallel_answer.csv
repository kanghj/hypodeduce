org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSimilarMethod(Invocation),0.710000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSimilarMethod(Invocation)` supports hypothesis H1 by focusing on method equality and verification status, which can be influenced by generic type parameters. If the expected and actual generic types differ, the method equality check (`hasSameMethod(Invocation)`) might fail, leading to incorrect stubbing or verification. In the test failures, casting the `iterable` to `(Iterable)` could alter the perceived method signature, causing the `hasSimilarMethod` check to fail due to mismatched method signatures or generic types."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.matches(Invocation),0.708632,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual behavior of the mock object due to incorrect handling of generic type inheritance in the Mockito framework.,org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.matches(Invocation)` supports Hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to the test failure through its reliance on `hasSameMethod(Invocation)` and `ArgumentsComparator.argumentsMatch`. These components may not correctly handle generic type inheritance, leading to mismatches when comparing methods or arguments. In the provided test failures, the casting of `iterable` to `Iterable` might cause `hasSameMethod(Invocation)` to fail, as it checks for method equality, which could be affected by the generic type handling in Mockito. This suggests that the method's logic might not fully accommodate the polymorphic nature of generics, aligning with the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of generic type inheritance."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSameMethod(Invocation),0.706842,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing or invocation.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.hasSameMethod(Invocation)` supports hypothesis H3 by addressing the issue of method equality in the presence of generics. It avoids using `Method.equals()` directly because Java can generate forwarding methods when generics are involved, which might lead to mismatches in method identification. This behavior aligns with the hypothesis that a mismatch in generic type parameters could cause incorrect method stubbing or invocation, as the method explicitly handles such cases by not relying solely on `Method.equals()`."
"org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.InvocationMatcher(Invocation,List)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `InvocationMatcher.InvocationMatcher(Invocation, List)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the test failure through its handling of matchers. If the list of matchers is empty, it defaults to using `argumentsToMatchers()` from the invocation, which might not correctly handle polymorphic method calls with different generic type parameters. This could lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual method signatures, causing the stubbing or verification to fail when the generic type parameters do not align as anticipated."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `InvocationMatcher.captureArgumentsFrom(Invocation)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially highlighting a mismatch in expected and actual generic type parameters during polymorphic method calls. This method captures arguments from an `Invocation` object, which includes the method's arguments. If the generic type parameters do not match, the captured arguments might not align with the expected types, leading to incorrect method stubbing or verification. In the test failures, the casting of `iterable` to `(Iterable)` might cause a mismatch in the expected generic type, resulting in the assertion and verification errors observed."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual behavior of the mock object due to incorrect handling of generic type inheritance in the Mockito framework.,org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getInvocation()` returns the stored `Invocation` instance, which is crucial for matching invocations during verification. In the context of hypothesis H2, if the `Invocation` instance does not correctly account for generic type inheritance, it could lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the mock object. Specifically, when verifying calls like `verify((Iterable) iterable).iterator()`, if the `Invocation` does not handle the polymorphic nature of generics properly, it may fail to match the invocation, supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of generic type inheritance."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMatchers(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMatchers()` returns a list of `Matcher` objects that are used to match arguments in a method invocation. This supports hypothesis H1 because if there is a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during a polymorphic method call, the `Matcher` objects may not correctly match the arguments, leading to incorrect method stubbing. In the provided test failures, the casting of `iterable` to `(Iterable)` might cause the `Matcher` to fail in recognizing the correct method signature, resulting in the assertion and verification errors."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMethod(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.getMethod()` retrieves the `Method` object from the invocation, which is crucial for matching the method call during stubbing or verification. This method does not directly handle generic type parameters, but it relies on the `Method` object that includes type information. If there is a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters, it could lead to incorrect method stubbing or verification because the `Method` object retrieved might not match the method signature expected by the test, supporting hypothesis H1. The failure in the test could be due to the `Method` object not aligning with the polymorphic call's expected generics, causing the stubbing or verification to fail."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.toString(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test failure might be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual generic type parameters during the polymorphic method call, leading to incorrect method stubbing.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher (HH2),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.InvocationMatcher.toString()` provides a string representation of the invocation matcher, which includes details about the method call and its arguments. This string representation can help identify discrepancies between expected and actual method calls, such as mismatches in generic type parameters. In the context of hypothesis H1, if the string representation reveals differences in the method signature or arguments due to polymorphic behavior, it would support the hypothesis that the test failure is caused by a mismatch in generic type parameters during the method call."
