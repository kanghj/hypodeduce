org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod.equals(Object),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect implementation of the `equals` method in the `DelegatingMethod` class, which does not properly handle equality checks for objects with equivalent state.",org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod (HH1),"The `equals` method in the `DelegatingMethod` class directly delegates the equality check to the `equals` method of its internal `Method` object. This implementation supports Hypothesis H1, as it only returns true if the input object is exactly the same `Method` instance as the internal `Method`, or if the input object is a `DelegatingMethod` with an identical internal `Method`. If the `DelegatingMethod` instances have equivalent but not identical `Method` objects, the `equals` method will return false, leading to the test failures observed."
org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod.DelegatingMethod(Method),0.800000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the `equals` method in the `DelegatingMethod` class, which does not properly handle all relevant fields for equality comparison.",org.mockito.internal.creation.DelegatingMethod (HH1),"The constructor `DelegatingMethod.DelegatingMethod(Method)` supports hypothesis H5 as it only initializes the `DelegatingMethod` object by assigning the input `Method` to an internal field without any additional logic or validation. This suggests that the `equals` method might not be correctly implemented to handle equality based on all relevant fields, as the constructor does not enforce or check any conditions beyond non-nullity of the input `Method`. The failure in the test cases indicates that the `equals` method might not be considering all necessary attributes for a proper equality check, leading to unexpected results."
