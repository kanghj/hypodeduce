com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations.applyCollapses(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable declaration collapsing logic that incorrectly handles edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations (HH1),"The method `applyCollapses()` supports hypothesis H1 as it merges variable declarations and assignments into a single `var` statement, which directly relates to the test failure involving incorrect handling of multiple variable declarations. The test failure shows that the expected output was `function f(a){var b=1;a=2;var c}` but the result was `function f(a){var b=1,a=2,c}`, indicating that the method incorrectly collapsed the declarations into a single statement. This suggests that recent changes in the collapsing logic might not properly handle edge cases, such as redeclarations, which `applyCollapses()` is responsible for managing."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations.process(Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable declaration collapsing logic that incorrectly handles edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for identifying and collapsing variable declarations within the AST. The test failure indicates that the method incorrectly transformed the input code by collapsing variable declarations into a single statement, resulting in `var b=1,a=2,c` instead of maintaining separate declarations as expected. This suggests that recent changes in the collapsing logic might not correctly handle cases where multiple variable declarations are involved, leading to incorrect transformations and supporting the hypothesis that edge cases are mishandled."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations$GatherCollapses.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable declaration collapsing logic that incorrectly handles edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations$GatherCollapses.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the test failure through its handling of variable declarations. The method specifically targets sequences of variable declarations and assignments for collapsing, which aligns with the test failure involving incorrect handling of multiple variable declarations in a single statement. The failure context shows that the expected output was not achieved due to the collapsing logic incorrectly treating `a=2` as part of the variable declaration sequence, suggesting that recent changes in this logic might have introduced a bug in handling such edge cases."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations.CollapseVariableDeclarations(AbstractCompiler),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable scoping rules within the JavaScript compiler that affects how variable declarations are collapsed, leading to unexpected behavior in the test case.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations (HH1),"The method `CollapseVariableDeclarations.CollapseVariableDeclarations(AbstractCompiler)` initializes the class with a given compiler, ensuring it is not yet normalized, but does not directly manipulate variable scoping rules or collapse variable declarations itself. Since the method does not invoke any other covered methods, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H2. The test failure is more likely related to how the compiler processes variable declarations elsewhere, rather than this constructor's initialization logic."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations$GatherCollapses.blacklistStubVars(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable declaration collapsing logic that incorrectly handles edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement.,,"The method `blacklistStubVars(NodeTraversal, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that variables without initializers are marked as blacklisted, preventing them from being redeclared or collapsed. This behavior is crucial in handling edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement, as seen in the test failure where variables `a` and `c` are incorrectly collapsed. The method's role in blacklisting stub variables suggests that a recent change might have altered how these variables are identified or processed, leading to the observed test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseVariableDeclarations$GatherCollapses.canBeRedeclared(Node,Scope)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a recent change in the variable declaration collapsing logic that incorrectly handles edge cases involving multiple variable declarations in a single statement.,,"The method `canBeRedeclared(Node, Scope)` checks if a node represents an assignment that can be safely redeclared as a variable declaration, ensuring it is not blacklisted. In the context of the test failure, this method supports hypothesis H1 because it directly influences whether variable assignments are collapsed into declarations. If the logic within `canBeRedeclared` incorrectly identifies assignments that should not be redeclared, it could lead to the erroneous collapsing of multiple variable declarations into a single statement, as seen in the test output where `a` and `c` are incorrectly redeclared. This suggests that a recent change in this logic might be mishandling such edge cases."
