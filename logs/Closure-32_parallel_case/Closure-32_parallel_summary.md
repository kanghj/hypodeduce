3. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser.parse()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output for specific test cases, leading to discrepancies in the test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser.parse()` is responsible for parsing JSDoc comments, which includes handling annotations and preserving formatting. In the context of Hypothesis H2, if the recent changes in...

4. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser.skipEOLs()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.parsing.JsDocInfoParser.skipEOLs()` is designed to skip over end-of-line (EOL) tokens and empty lines within JSDoc comments, which suggests that it could affect how multiline comments are parsed a...

5. **com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.build(Node)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.build(Node)` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it primarily deals with building and associating JSDocInfo objects with nodes, rather than altering code outp...

6. **com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.markAnnotation(String,int,int)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.markAnnotation(String,int,int)` primarily deals with adding markers and setting annotation information within JSDoc comments, without directly interacting with the JavaScript compi...

7. **com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.markText(String,int,int,int,int)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.markText(String, int, int, int, int)` is responsible for adding a textual block to the current marker, which suggests it deals with tracking or recording positions of text blocks. ...

8. **com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.recordOriginalCommentString(String)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.recordOriginalCommentString(String)` is primarily responsible for storing the original JSDoc comment string if the builder is configured to parse documentation. This method does no...

9. **com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.JSDocInfoBuilder(boolean)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.IntegrationTest::testIssue701" might be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript compiler's optimization logic that inadvertently alters the expected output of the test case. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.JSDocInfoBuilder.JSDocInfoBuilder(boolean)` initializes a JSDocInfo object and sets a flag for documentation parsing, but it does not directly interact with or influence the JavaScript compiler's o...
