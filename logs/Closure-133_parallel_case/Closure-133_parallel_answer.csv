The failure in `testTextExtents` could be related to this method if recent changes affected how it handles whitespace or comment delimiters, potentially causing it to misinterpret the boundaries of text blocks. The stack trace indicates that the method might be incorrectly calculating text positions, as evidenced by the ""start-char: 14 end-char: 13"" output, which suggests a logical error in determining text extents, possibly due to altered whitespace handling."

This could lead to incorrect parsing if recent changes affected how whitespace or comment delimiters are interpreted, potentially causing the failure in `testTextExtents`. The method's reliance on single-line whitespace handling might not correctly account for multiline scenarios, leading to the recorded bad position information error."

The method processes tokens until the end of comment (EOC) is reached, and any recent changes in how it interprets or marks text extents could lead to incorrect parsing, as evidenced by the ""Recorded bad position information"" error. The error in the test, where the start character is greater than the end character, suggests a miscalculation in text extent handling, aligning with the hypothesis that recent changes might have introduced this parsing issue."

If there were recent changes in how this method processes these elements, it could lead to incorrect parsing of text extents, as seen in the failure context. The method's reliance on `next()` and `getRemainingJSDocLine()` suggests it processes lines and tokens sequentially, and any alteration in these processes could affect the position information, aligning with the hypothesis of whitespace or delimiter handling issues."

If recent modifications altered how tokens are recognized or delimited, this method might incorrectly parse or fail to recognize type expressions, leading to the ""Bad type annotation"" error observed in `testTextExtents`. The method's reliance on correctly identifying type nodes suggests that any disruption in token parsing could result in the recorded bad position information error."
