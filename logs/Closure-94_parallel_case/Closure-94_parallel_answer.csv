The failure at `assertTrue(testValidDefineValue(""1 + 8""))` suggests that the method might not recognize this expression as a valid define value due to changes in how node types or operations are processed, thus supporting the hypothesis."

If the traversal logic or stack updates were changed recently, it could cause the test to fail due to mismatches in expected node processing."

This suggests that its role is limited to maintaining state during node traversal and does not directly alter node behavior or structure. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not modify node properties or behaviors that could lead to the test failure. The failure might be more related to changes elsewhere in the codebase affecting node evaluation or test expectations."
