"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.addRelatedInterfaces(ObjectType,Set)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `addRelatedInterfaces` supports Hypothesis H1 by recursively adding related interfaces to a set, which could lead to an infinite loop if there is a circular dependency in the type hierarchy. Specifically, if a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, the method would repeatedly call itself for the same interface, causing a cycle. The test failure indicates a cycle detected in the inheritance chain, which aligns with the method's behavior of recursively processing interfaces, potentially leading to infinite recursion in the presence of circular dependencies."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getAllImplementedInterfaces(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getAllImplementedInterfaces()` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the test failure due to its behavior of returning all interfaces implemented by a class or its superclass. If there is a circular dependency, such as a class implementing or extending itself (e.g., `G` implements `F` and `F` extends `G`), this method could inadvertently participate in an infinite loop or incomplete resolution during type checking. The method's reliance on resolving all types before being called suggests that if types are not fully resolved due to a circular dependency, it may return an incomplete or incorrect set of interfaces, leading to unexpected warnings or errors."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getImplementedInterfaces(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getImplementedInterfaces()` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the detection of circular dependencies in the type hierarchy. This method retrieves interfaces implemented by a class or its superclass, which is relevant when checking for cycles in inheritance chains. In the test failure context, the method could be involved in identifying that `G` implements `F`, and `F` extends `G`, creating a cycle. The presence of this cycle could lead to an infinite loop during type checking, as the method would repeatedly traverse the same interfaces, supporting the hypothesis of a circular dependency causing the test failure."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getSuperClassConstructor(),0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a cyclic dependency in the type hierarchy that is not being properly detected or handled by the type checking logic.,com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getSuperClassConstructor()` supports Hypothesis H3 by providing a mechanism to retrieve the superclass constructor of a given constructor or interface type. In the context of the failure, the method checks for cyclic dependencies by attempting to access the superclass constructor through the prototype chain. If a cycle exists, this method might return a non-null value when it should not, indicating a failure in detecting the cycle. The failure in the test `testImplementsExtendsLoop` suggests that the type checking logic did not properly handle the cyclic dependency between `G` and `F`, as evidenced by the unexpected warnings and the assertion failure."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setImplementedInterfaces(List),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setImplementedInterfaces(List)` supports Hypothesis H1 by ensuring that only constructors can have implemented interfaces set, which helps prevent circular dependencies in the type hierarchy. In the test failure, the error ""JSC_IMPLEMENTS_NON_INTERFACE"" indicates that the code attempts to implement a non-interface type, suggesting a misuse of the `@implements` annotation. This misuse aligns with H1, as it could lead to a circular dependency if a class is incorrectly allowed to implement itself, causing an infinite loop during type checking. The method's restriction on setting implemented interfaces only for constructors helps mitigate such issues by enforcing correct type hierarchy structures."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setPrototypeBasedOn(ObjectType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setPrototypeBasedOn(ObjectType)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the circular dependency issue. When this method is called, it sets the prototype of a function type based on a given object type. If the object type is part of a circular dependency (e.g., a class implementing or extending itself), this method could inadvertently establish or reinforce the cycle, leading to an infinite loop during type checking. The test failure indicates a cycle in the inheritance chain, which aligns with the method's role in setting prototypes that could perpetuate such cycles."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isInterface(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isInterface()` supports hypothesis H1 by determining whether a function type is an interface, which is crucial in identifying incorrect implementations or extensions. In the test failure, the error ""JSC_IMPLEMENTS_NON_INTERFACE"" indicates that a non-interface type is being implemented, suggesting a misuse of the `isInterface()` check. If `isInterface()` incorrectly identifies a class as an interface, it could allow a class to implement itself, contributing to the circular dependency and infinite loop described in H1. The method's role in verifying interface status is directly related to preventing such type hierarchy issues."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getExtendedInterfaces(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getExtendedInterfaces()` returns the list of interfaces directly extended by a given interface, which is relevant to hypothesis H1. If a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, this method could return a list that includes the class itself, indicating a circular dependency. In the test failure context, the error message ""Cycle detected in inheritance chain of type F"" suggests that the method might have identified such a cycle, supporting H1 by showing that the type hierarchy contains a loop where a class is improperly extending or implementing itself."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isConstructor(),0.300000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a cyclic dependency in the type hierarchy that is not being correctly detected or handled by the type checking logic.,com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isConstructor()` supports hypothesis H4 by determining whether a function type is a constructor, which is crucial for identifying cyclic dependencies in type hierarchies. In the failure context, the test involves constructors (`G` and `F`) with a cyclic inheritance chain. If `isConstructor()` correctly identifies these as constructors, it aids in detecting cycles. However, if it fails to recognize them, it could lead to undetected cycles, supporting the hypothesis that the type checking logic might not handle cyclic dependencies properly."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setExtendedInterfaces(List),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a circular dependency in the type hierarchy, where a class is incorrectly allowed to implement or extend itself, leading to an infinite loop during type checking.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setExtendedInterfaces(List)` supports Hypothesis H1 by enforcing that only interfaces can have extended interfaces. If a class incorrectly attempts to implement or extend itself, this method would throw an exception, preventing the circular dependency. In the test failure context, the error ""JSC_IMPLEMENTS_NON_INTERFACE"" indicates that the code attempted to implement a non-interface, which aligns with the hypothesis that a circular dependency might be causing the issue, as the method would not allow setting extended interfaces for non-interface types."
