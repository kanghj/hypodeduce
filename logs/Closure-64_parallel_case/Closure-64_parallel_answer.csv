"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource(Node,Format,boolean,int,SourceMap,DetailLevel,Charset,boolean)",0.310000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a syntax error in one of the multiple input files that violates ES5 strict mode rules, leading to a compilation error.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource(Node, Format, boolean, int, SourceMap, DetailLevel, Charset, boolean)` is responsible for converting an abstract syntax tree (AST) into JavaScript code. It does not directly handle syntax error detection or strict mode validation; these tasks are typically managed during the parsing and compilation phases before code generation. Therefore, this method's role in generating the output source code does not support the hypothesis H1 that a syntax error in the input files is causing the test failure. Instead, the method assumes that the input AST is already valid and focuses on formatting it into JavaScript code."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setTagAsStrict(boolean),0.308632,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test environment that does not correctly handle multiple input files when enforcing ES5 strict mode.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setTagAsStrict(boolean)` sets a flag to determine if the output should be tagged as ECMASCRIPT 5 Strict. This method supports Hypothesis H2 because if the flag `tagAsStrict` is not correctly set or propagated due to a misconfiguration, it could result in the failure to consistently apply the 'use strict' directive across multiple input files. The test failure indicates that 'use strict' is not found beyond the initial position, suggesting that the strict mode might not be applied uniformly, potentially due to this misconfiguration."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build(),0.306842,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a syntax error in one of the multiple input files that violates ES5 strict mode rules, leading to a compilation error.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build()` generates and returns the source code, assuming a valid root node is provided. If there were a syntax error in the input files violating ES5 strict mode rules, it would likely prevent the creation of a valid root node, causing an exception before reaching the `build()` method. Since the method does not handle syntax validation itself, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as the failure would occur earlier in the compilation process."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String),0.304526,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test environment that does not correctly handle multiple input files when enforcing ES5 strict mode.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String)` is responsible for appending strings to the code and updating the line length, but it does not directly handle or manage multiple input files or the enforcement of ES5 strict mode. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it operates at a lower level of code manipulation without awareness of the test environment configuration or how multiple inputs are processed. The failure in the test likely arises from a higher-level issue related to how the test environment processes multiple input files, rather than from the string appending functionality of this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test environment that does not correctly handle multiple input files when enforcing ES5 strict mode.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode()` returns the accumulated code as a string, which suggests that it processes and concatenates multiple input files into a single output. If the method correctly accumulates code from multiple inputs, it should handle the insertion of `'use strict'` consistently across all inputs. The failure in the test, where `'use strict'` appears more than once, indicates that the method may not be correctly managing the insertion of `'use strict'` for multiple inputs, supporting Hypothesis H2 that there might be a misconfiguration in handling multiple files in strict mode."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.maybeCutLine(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a syntax error in one of the multiple input files that violates ES5 strict mode rules, leading to a compilation error.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.maybeCutLine()` is primarily concerned with managing line lengths by inserting line breaks, rather than handling syntax errors or strict mode violations. It checks if the current line exceeds a certain length and then decides whether to insert a line break or start a new line, which is unrelated to syntax validation. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with syntax checking or strict mode compliance, which are likely handled earlier in the compilation process."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a syntax error in one of the multiple input files that violates ES5 strict mode rules, leading to a compilation error.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node)` primarily deals with source mapping rather than syntax validation or error handling related to ES5 strict mode. It starts source mapping if certain conditions are met, focusing on mapping data structures rather than syntax correctness. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not engage with syntax checking or error reporting that could lead to the test failure described."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by a syntax error in one of the multiple input files that violates ES5 strict mode rules, leading to a compilation error.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node)` is responsible for finalizing source mapping for a node, which involves updating the end position of the mapping if source mapping is enabled. This method does not directly handle syntax errors or ES5 strict mode violations; it focuses on source mapping. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with the syntax validation or error handling processes that could lead to a compilation error due to ES5 strict mode violations. The test failure is more likely related to the handling of strict mode directives rather than source mapping."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setLineBreak(boolean),0.200000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by a misconfiguration in the test environment that does not correctly handle multiple input files when enforcing ES5 strict mode.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setLineBreak(boolean)` is unrelated to handling multiple input files or enforcing ES5 strict mode. It simply sets a flag to determine whether line breaks should be inserted in the output code, which does not affect how multiple input files are processed or how strict mode is enforced. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not interact with the test environment configuration or the handling of strict mode across multiple files."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean),0.200000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a misconfiguration in the test environment that does not correctly handle multiple input files when enforcing ES5 strict mode.,,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean)` is unrelated to hypothesis H3, as it only affects the formatting of the output code by enabling or disabling pretty printing. It does not influence how multiple input files are handled or how ES5 strict mode is enforced. The failure in the test is due to the unexpected presence of multiple `'use strict'` directives, which suggests an issue with how the compiler processes multiple inputs, not with the pretty printing configuration."
