The failure in the test occurs because the method attempts to validate an `Invocation` on an interface, which lacks concrete method implementations. The `validate` method checks the type of `Answer` and delegates to specific validation methods, but it does not handle the scenario where a real method call is attempted on an interface. This aligns with the hypothesis that the test setup incorrectly assumes a real method can be invoked on an interface, leading to the failure."
