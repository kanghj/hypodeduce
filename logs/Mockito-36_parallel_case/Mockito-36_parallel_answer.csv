org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation.callRealMethod(),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by an attempt to invoke a real method on an interface, which lacks a concrete implementation, leading to an UnsupportedOperationException.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.Invocation.callRealMethod()` attempts to invoke a real method on a mock object using `realMethod.invoke(mock, rawArguments)`. The failure context indicates a `NullPointerException` rather than an `UnsupportedOperationException`, suggesting that the issue arises from a null reference, likely `realMethod` or `mock`, rather than the absence of a concrete implementation. This contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the error is not due to invoking a method on an interface without implementation but rather due to a null reference during the invocation process."
org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod(MockitoMethodProxy),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test may be failing due to a recent change in the interface's method signature, which is not compatible with the current implementation of the real method invocation logic.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod (HH1),"The method `CGLIBProxyRealMethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod(MockitoMethodProxy)` initializes an instance by assigning a `MockitoMethodProxy` to an internal field, without interacting with the method signature or invocation logic. This suggests that the constructor itself does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H2, as it does not involve checking or adapting to changes in method signatures. The failure is more likely related to the invocation logic in `Invocation.callRealMethod`, which could be affected by signature changes, rather than the initialization process handled by `CGLIBProxyRealMethod`."
"org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod.invoke(Object,Object[])",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The test may be failing due to a recent change in the interface's method signature, which is not compatible with the current implementation of the real method invocation logic.",org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.invocation.realmethod.CGLIBProxyRealMethod.invoke(Object,Object[])` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H2 because it focuses on invoking the original method implementation using `methodProxy.invokeSuper`. The failure in the test is due to a `NullPointerException` at `Invocation.callRealMethod`, which suggests that the issue might be related to the setup or invocation logic rather than a change in the interface's method signature. The method summary indicates that it relies on `methodProxy`, and if `methodProxy` is null or improperly initialized due to a signature change, it could indirectly support H2."
