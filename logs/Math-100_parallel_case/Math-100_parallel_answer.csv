org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.getCovariances(EstimationProblem),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `getCovariances(EstimationProblem problem)` in `AbstractEstimator` is designed to compute the covariance matrix for unbound estimated parameters. The failure in the test `testBoundParameters` with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests that the method may not correctly handle cases where parameters are at or near their bounds, as it attempts to access an index that does not exist. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method's logic might not properly account for the presence of bound parameters, leading to incorrect array indexing when constructing the covariance matrix. The exception occurs when the method tries to access an index beyond the available range, indicating a potential flaw in handling boundary conditions."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.initializeEstimate(EstimationProblem),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" might be caused by incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `initializeEstimate(EstimationProblem)` resets counters and retrieves equations, but it does not explicitly handle boundary conditions for parameters. This supports Hypothesis H4, as the failure might be due to the absence of logic to manage parameters at or near their bounds during initialization. The lack of boundary condition handling in this method could lead to unexpected results, such as the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed in the test."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.updateResidualsAndCost(),0.400000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.updateResidualsAndCost()` updates residuals and computes the cost, which involves handling parameter values. If boundary conditions are incorrectly managed, this could lead to incorrect residuals or cost calculations, potentially supporting Hypothesis H3. However, the method does not explicitly address boundary conditions, so while it could contribute to the failure if boundary handling is flawed, it does not directly confirm or contradict H3 without further evidence of how boundaries are managed elsewhere in the code."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.AbstractEstimator(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.AbstractEstimator()` is a protected constructor that initializes the estimator for least squares problems, but it does not directly handle parameter bounds. The failure in `GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters` with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests an issue with array handling rather than boundary condition logic. Since the constructor does not manage parameter bounds, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly; the error likely arises from elsewhere in the parameter estimation logic where bounds are processed."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.updateJacobian(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `updateJacobian()` initializes the Jacobian matrix by filling it with zeros and then iterates over measurements to update it. This process does not inherently handle boundary conditions for parameters, as it focuses on matrix updates rather than parameter constraints. The failure in `testBoundParameters` could be due to the lack of explicit boundary condition checks within `updateJacobian()`, supporting Hypothesis H1 that boundary conditions might not be correctly managed, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.getRMS(EstimationProblem),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testBoundParameters"" might be caused by incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the Gauss-Newton algorithm, leading to convergence issues or incorrect parameter estimation.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.getRMS(EstimationProblem)` calculates the RMS of the weighted residuals, which is a measure of the fit quality between the estimated parameters and the observed data. If the RMS value is high, it indicates poor convergence or incorrect parameter estimation, which supports Hypothesis H2. However, the method itself does not directly handle boundary conditions; it only evaluates the fit quality. Therefore, while a high RMS could suggest issues related to boundary conditions, the method does not inherently address or contradict the handling of such conditions in the Gauss-Newton algorithm."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.setMaxCostEval(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.setMaxCostEval(int)` sets a limit on the number of cost evaluations by assigning the input value to the `maxCostEval` field. This method does not directly interact with parameter boundary conditions or their handling logic. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it is unrelated to the logic that manages parameter bounds or the estimation process that could lead to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The failure is more likely due to an issue elsewhere in the code, such as incorrect array indexing when handling parameters."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.getCostEvaluations(),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testBoundParameters"" might be caused by incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the Gauss-Newton algorithm, leading to convergence issues or incorrect parameter estimation.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.getCostEvaluations()` simply returns the current count of cost evaluations, stored in the `costEvaluations` field, and does not directly interact with boundary conditions or parameter handling. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not influence the handling of boundary conditions or convergence behavior in the Gauss-Newton algorithm. The failure in ""testBoundParameters"" is more likely related to array handling issues, as indicated by the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, rather than the number of cost evaluations."
org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator.incrementJacobianEvaluationsCounter(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.estimation.GaussNewtonEstimatorTest::testBoundParameters"" could be due to incorrect handling of boundary conditions in the parameter estimation logic, leading to unexpected results when parameters are at or near their bounds.",org.apache.commons.math.estimation.AbstractEstimator (HH1),"The method `incrementJacobianEvaluationsCounter()` simply increments a counter tracking the number of times the Jacobian matrix is evaluated. It does not directly interact with parameter values or boundary conditions. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not influence how parameters are handled at or near their bounds. The failure due to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is more likely related to incorrect array handling elsewhere in the code, rather than the incrementing of a counter."
