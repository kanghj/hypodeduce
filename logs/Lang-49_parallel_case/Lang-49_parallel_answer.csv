org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.reduce(),0.900000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" might be caused by an incorrect implementation of the `reduce` method that does not properly handle edge cases involving negative numerators or denominators.",org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction (HH5),"The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" suggests that the `reduce` method may not correctly handle edge cases involving negative numerators or denominators. The test case `Fraction.getFraction(2, -3)` expects the reduced fraction to be `-2/3`, indicating that the sign should be applied to the numerator. However, the stack trace shows an unexpected result, which implies that the `reduce` method might not be correctly managing the sign during the reduction process. This supports Hypothesis H2, as the method's handling of negative values seems to be flawed, leading to incorrect assertions in the test."
"org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(int,int)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the algorithm that reduces fractions, possibly mishandling edge cases like negative numbers or zero.",org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.greatestCommonDivisor(int,int)` supports Hypothesis H4 as a potential cause for the failure in `FractionTest::testReduce`. If the GCD algorithm incorrectly handles edge cases such as negative numbers, it could lead to incorrect reduction of fractions, as seen in the test case where the expected numerator was 1 but the actual was 100. The binary GCD algorithm's handling of negative values or zero could directly affect the fraction reduction process, leading to assertion failures."
"org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getFraction(int,int)",0.300000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" could be due to incorrect handling of negative numerators or denominators during the reduction process.",org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getFraction(int, int)` supports Hypothesis H3 because it resolves any negative signs to be on the numerator. This behavior could lead to incorrect handling of negative numerators or denominators during the reduction process, as seen in the test case `Fraction.getFraction(2, -3)`, where the expected result is a fraction with a negative numerator. If the method incorrectly adjusts the sign, it could cause the reduction to fail, as indicated by the assertion failure in the test."
org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getNumerator(),0.200000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" could be due to incorrect handling of negative numerators or denominators during the reduction process.",org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getNumerator()` simply returns the numerator of the fraction without performing any operations or checks on its sign. This supports Hypothesis H3, as the failure in the test could be due to the reduction process not correctly handling negative numerators or denominators, leading to unexpected results. The test case where `Fraction.getFraction(2, -3)` results in a numerator of `-2` instead of `2` suggests that the reduction process might not be correctly normalizing the sign of the fraction, which `getNumerator()` would then return as-is."
org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getDenominator(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.math.FractionTest::testReduce"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of the algorithm that reduces fractions, potentially mishandling edge cases such as negative numbers or zero.",org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.math.Fraction.getDenominator()` simply returns the denominator of the fraction and does not perform any operations that could affect the reduction process. Since it does not interact with the reduction algorithm or handle edge cases like negative numbers or zero, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1. The failure in the test is more likely related to the logic within the `reduce()` method itself, rather than the `getDenominator()` method."
