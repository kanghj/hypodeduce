## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties.process(Node,Node)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testAliasing7" may be caused by incorrect handling or recognition of aliased prototype properties, leading to their unintended removal during optimization. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1. It creates an `AnalyzePrototypeProperties` instance to analyze prototype properties, which suggests that it is responsi...

2. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties.removeUnusedSymbols(Collection)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testAliasing7" may be caused by incorrect handling or recognition of aliased prototype properties, leading to their unintended removal during optimization. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `removeUnusedSymbols(Collection<NameInfo> allNameInfo)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in "testAliasing7" due to its logic of removing properties that are not referenced. If the method incorr...

3. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties(AbstractCompiler,boolean,boolean)** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "testAliasing7" may be caused by incorrect handling or recognition of aliased prototype properties, leading to their unintended removal during optimization. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties.RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties(AbstractCompiler, boolean, boolean)` initializes the removal process with specific configurations that determine how prototype properties are handled during opti...
