"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource(Node,Format,boolean,int,SourceMap,DetailLevel,Charset,boolean)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter (HH2),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource` is responsible for converting a syntax tree (Node) into JavaScript code, which directly relates to the formatting logic that could cause the test failure. Given that the test failure involves a discrepancy in handling the negative zero (`-0.0`) syntax, it is plausible that a recent change in this method's logic could have altered how specific edge cases, like negative zero, are formatted. The method's parameters, such as `Format`, `lineBreak`, and `DetailLevel`, suggest that it has the capability to influence the output format, supporting Hypothesis H1 that a change in this method could lead to unexpected output in the test."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build()` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly influences the code formatting logic by generating the source code through the `toSource` method. This method is responsible for converting the abstract syntax tree (AST) into a string representation, and any recent changes in its logic could affect how specific syntax, such as negative zero, is handled. The failure in `testIssue582` indicates a discrepancy in the expected versus actual output, suggesting that the `toSource` method might not be correctly formatting the `-0.0` value, potentially due to recent modifications in its implementation."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String)` directly appends strings to the code buffer without altering the content, suggesting it does not independently modify the syntax or handle edge cases. Since it simply updates the line length and appends the string as-is, the failure in `testIssue582` is unlikely caused by this method alone. Instead, the issue may stem from earlier stages in the code formatting logic that prepare or transform the input before reaching this append operation, supporting hypothesis H1 that a recent change elsewhere in the formatting logic could be responsible for the unexpected output."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode(),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the code printer logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or formatting, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode()` simply converts the internal `StringBuilder` to a string and does not involve any logic for handling syntax or formatting. This suggests that the method itself is unlikely to directly support Hypothesis H2, as it does not perform any operations that could alter the code's syntax or formatting. The issue is more likely to reside in the logic that populates the `StringBuilder` before `getCode()` is called, rather than in the method itself."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getLastChar(),0.300000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" might be caused by a recent change in the code printing logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases in JavaScript syntax, leading to malformed output.",,"The method `getLastChar()` returns the last character in the code buffer or '\0' if the buffer is empty, which suggests it plays a role in determining the final output of the code printing process. If the buffer incorrectly omits the '-' character due to a recent change in handling edge cases, this method would return '0' instead of '-0', supporting Hypothesis H5. The failure context shows the expected output as ""var x=-0.0"" but the actual output as ""var x=0"", indicating that the '-' character might have been improperly handled or omitted, aligning with the hypothesis of a recent change affecting edge case handling."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.maybeCutLine(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.maybeCutLine()` is unlikely to support Hypothesis H1 because its primary function is to manage line length by inserting line breaks, which is unrelated to the formatting of specific syntax like `-0.0`. The failure in `testIssue582` involves the incorrect handling of the `-0.0` value, which suggests an issue with how the code handles numeric formatting rather than line length management. Since `maybeCutLine()` does not interact with numeric formatting logic or the specific syntax in question, it does not directly support or contradict the hypothesis regarding recent changes affecting syntax handling."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node)` is responsible for finalizing source mapping for a node, ensuring that the mapping stack is correctly managed. It does not directly handle code formatting logic or syntax processing, which suggests that it is unlikely to be the root cause of the formatting issue observed in the test failure. The failure in `testIssue582` involves incorrect handling of the `-0.0` syntax, which is more likely related to the code formatting logic rather than source mapping, thus contradicting Hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node)` is responsible for initiating source mapping for a node if certain conditions are met, but it does not directly influence the formatting logic or output generation. Since it does not call other methods related to code formatting, it is unlikely to directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1. The failure in `testIssue582` is more likely related to the code formatting logic itself, rather than the source mapping process, as the method in question does not alter the printed output or handle syntax-specific cases."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the code printer logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or formatting, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean)` sets a flag that determines whether the output should be formatted in a human-readable way. Since the method only sets a flag and does not directly manipulate or process the code, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2 directly. The failure in `testIssue582` is more likely related to the logic that handles the formatting or printing of specific syntax, rather than the setting of the prettyPrint flag itself."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.notePreferredLineBreak(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testIssue582"" may be caused by a recent change in the code formatting logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax or edge cases, leading to unexpected output.",,"The method `notePreferredLineBreak()` records the current position in the code buffer as a preferred line break, which suggests it is involved in formatting decisions. However, since it does not call other methods, it likely does not directly influence the specific syntax handling or edge cases related to the failure in `testIssue582`. The failure, which involves incorrect handling of `-0.0`, seems unrelated to line breaks, indicating that `notePreferredLineBreak()` neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly."
