The failure in `testSupplementaryUnescaping` suggests that the method may not correctly handle supplementary Unicode characters, which are represented by surrogate pairs in UTF-16. The expected character `ê∞¢` (U+10C22) is a supplementary character, but the method returned `‡∞¢` (U+0A22), indicating a potential issue in the conversion logic, possibly due to incorrect handling of surrogate pairs or misinterpretation of the numeric entity value."
