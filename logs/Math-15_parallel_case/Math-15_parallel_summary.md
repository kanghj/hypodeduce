# GPT-only Results for Math-15

## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.pow(double,double)** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1).
    Explanation: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904" supports Hypothesis H1, as the discrepancy arises when computing `FastMath.pow(-1, y)` where `y` is a large positive number. The expected result is `-1.0`, but `Fas...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double,double,double[])** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double, double, double[])` is designed to handle exponential calculations with additional precision through its parameters `extra` and `hiPrec`. This suggests that the method is inte...

3. **org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.log(double,double[])** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge cases for specific mathematical functions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.log(double, double[])` is designed to handle edge cases, such as when `x` is zero, by returning `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. This suggests that the FastMath library is aware of precision ...

4. **org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.max(int,int)** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect calculations. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.max(int,int)` is unrelated to the failure in `FastMathTest::testMath904` because it deals with integer inputs and simply returns the maximum of two integers using a conditional expressio...
