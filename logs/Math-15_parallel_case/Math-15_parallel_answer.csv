"org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.pow(double,double)",0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904"" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect results.",org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1),"The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904"" supports Hypothesis H1, as the discrepancy arises when computing `FastMath.pow(-1, y)` where `y` is a large positive number. The expected result is `-1.0`, but `FastMath.pow` returns `1.0`, indicating a precision error or incorrect handling of edge cases involving negative bases and large exponents. The method's implementation likely does not correctly handle the sign of the result when `x` is negative and `y` is a large odd integer, leading to the observed failure."
"org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double,double,double[])",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904"" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect results.",org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.exp(double, double, double[])` is designed to handle exponential calculations with additional precision through its parameters `extra` and `hiPrec`. This suggests that the method is intended to manage precision more effectively than standard implementations. However, the failure in `FastMathTest::testMath904` involves the `FastMath.pow` function, not `exp`, and the discrepancy arises from handling negative bases with large exponents, which is not directly related to the precision management in `exp`. Therefore, while `exp` aims to enhance precision, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1 regarding the precision error in `FastMath.pow`."
"org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.log(double,double[])",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904"" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge cases for specific mathematical functions.",org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.log(double, double[])` is designed to handle edge cases, such as when `x` is zero, by returning `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`. This suggests that the FastMath library is aware of precision issues and attempts to address them in specific scenarios. However, the failure in `FastMathTest::testMath904` involves the `pow` function, not `log`, and the discrepancy between `Math.pow(x, y)` and `FastMath.pow(x, y)` indicates a potential precision error in handling negative bases with large exponents, which is not directly related to the `log` method's handling of precision. Thus, while the `log` method shows an awareness of precision issues, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H2 regarding the `pow` function's precision handling."
"org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.max(int,int)",0.100000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMathTest::testMath904"" could be due to a precision error in the FastMath library's handling of edge case inputs, leading to incorrect calculations.",org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.FastMath.max(int,int)` is unrelated to the failure in `FastMathTest::testMath904` because it deals with integer inputs and simply returns the maximum of two integers using a conditional expression. The failure in `testMath904` involves floating-point arithmetic with `Math.pow` and `FastMath.pow`, specifically with negative bases and large exponents, which are not relevant to the integer-based logic of `FastMath.max(int,int)`. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3 regarding precision errors in handling edge case inputs in floating-point calculations."
