In the test `testBug1864222`, the `start` date (1st December 2005) is indeed after the `end` date (18th January 2006), which directly causes the failure. This error is unrelated to time zone settings, as the exception is based solely on the chronological order of the provided dates, contradicting Hypothesis H1."

This suggests that the failure is due to the indices provided to the `createCopy` method rather than a time zone mismatch. The test case uses `createCopy(new Day(1, 12, 2005), new Day(18, 1, 2006))`, which translates to indices where the start date is after the end date, directly causing the exception. Therefore, the method behavior contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the failure is unrelated to time zone settings."

This method does not directly involve time zone settings, as it primarily initializes the series with default parameters. The failure in `testBug1864222` is due to an `IllegalArgumentException` caused by the `createCopy` method, which checks if the start date is less than or equal to the end date.

The failure in `testBug1864222` is due to an `IllegalArgumentException` caused by the `createCopy` method, which requires the start date to be less than or equal to the end date.
