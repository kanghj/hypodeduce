(confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Normalize$DuplicateDeclarationHandler.onRedeclaration` supports Hypothesis H1 by enforcing a check on variable redeclarations during scope creation, which aligns with the failure context where dup...

3. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.Normalize$ScopeTicklingCallback.enterScope(NodeTraversal)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.Normalize$ScopeTicklingCallback.enterScope(NodeTraversal)` supports Hypothesis H1 by explicitly triggering the creation of a scope through `t.getScope()`, which is responsible for detecting duplic...

4. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.createSynthesizedExternVar(String)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.createSynthesizedExternVar(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure through its handling of undeclared variables. If recent changes in the JavaScript nor...

5. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.VarCheck(AbstractCompiler,boolean)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.VarCheck(AbstractCompiler, boolean)` initializes a `VarCheck` instance, which is responsible for variable checking, including handling undefined variables and strict extern checks. This m...

6. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.process(Node,Node)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.process(Node,Node)` traverses the externs and root nodes to check for variable declarations and references, which suggests it plays a role in identifying issues with variable handling. Th...

7. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H1 by focusing on validating variable declarations and ensuring proper module dependencies, which aligns with the failure context inv...

8. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.getSynthesizedExternsInput()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.getSynthesizedExternsInput()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it primarily deals with creating synthetic externs for undeclared variables rather than handling sy...

9. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.getSynthesizedExternsRoot()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck.getSynthesizedExternsRoot()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it primarily deals with the creation and retrieval of a synthetic externs root for undeclared variab...

10. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.VarCheck$NameRefInExternsCheck.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.NormalizeTest::testIssue" may be caused by a recent change in the JavaScript normalization logic that incorrectly handles specific syntax patterns, leading to unexpected test results.
