"org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder.append(Object,Object)",0.900000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a precision mismatch when comparing BigDecimal values due to differences in scale or rounding mode settings.,org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder.append(Object, Object)` relies on the `equals` method of the `BigDecimal` class to determine equality. In Java, `BigDecimal.equals(Object)` considers two `BigDecimal` objects equal only if they have the same value and scale. In the test case, `o1` (""2.0"") and `o2` (""2.00"") have the same numeric value but different scales, causing `equals` to return `false`. This supports hypothesis H5, as the failure is due to a precision mismatch related to scale differences, not rounding mode settings."
org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder.EqualsBuilder(),0.200000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilderTest::testBigDecimal"" might be caused by a precision mismatch or incorrect handling of scale differences between BigDecimal instances being compared.",org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder (HH1),"The `EqualsBuilder.EqualsBuilder()` method initializes an `EqualsBuilder` instance with the assumption that objects are equal, but it does not inherently address precision or scale differences in `BigDecimal` comparisons. In the test case, `o1` and `o2` are `BigDecimal` instances with different scales (""2.0"" vs. ""2.00""), which are considered unequal by default `BigDecimal` comparison rules. Since the `EqualsBuilder` does not modify this behavior, the failure supports hypothesis H1, indicating a precision mismatch or incorrect handling of scale differences."
org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder.isEquals(),0.100000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilderTest::testBigDecimal"" might be caused by a precision mismatch or incorrect handling of scale differences between BigDecimal instances being compared.",org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.builder.EqualsBuilder.isEquals()` simply returns the value of the `isEquals` field, which is set based on the comparisons made by the `EqualsBuilder.append()` method. The failure in the test case occurs because `EqualsBuilder.append(o1, o2)` likely does not handle the scale differences between `BigDecimal` instances `o1` (""2.0"") and `o2` (""2.00"") correctly, leading to `isEquals` being set to `false`. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the method does not account for precision or scale differences, resulting in the test failure."
