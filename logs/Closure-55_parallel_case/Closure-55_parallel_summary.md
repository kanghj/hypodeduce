(confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$GetterReducer.getGetPropertyName(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure if recent changes in function rewriting logic affect how getter patterns ...

7. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$IdentityReducer.reduce(Node)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriterTest::testIssue538" might be caused by a recent change in the function rewriting logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior during test execution. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$IdentityReducer.reduce(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure if recent changes in the function rewriting logic have altered how specific edge ca...

8. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$Reducer.buildCallNode(String,Node,int,int)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriterTest::testIssue538" might be caused by a recent change in the function rewriting logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior during test execution. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$Reducer.buildCallNode(String,Node,int,int)` constructs a method call node using the provided method name, argument, and source location. If recent changes in the function rewritin...

9. **com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$Reduction.apply()** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriterTest::testIssue538" might be caused by a recent change in the function rewriting logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior during test execution. (confidence 0.700).
    Explanation: The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.FunctionRewriter$Reduction.apply()` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly manipulates the AST by replacing nodes, which could introduce errors if recent changes in the function rewriting logic inc...
