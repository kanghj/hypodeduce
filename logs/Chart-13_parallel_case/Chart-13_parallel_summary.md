## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrangeFF(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,RectangleConstraint)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `arrangeFF` in the `BorderArrangement` class is responsible for arranging items within a container based on the provided constraints. The failure context indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an invalid range where th...

2. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrangeFN(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,double)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `arrangeFN` in the `BorderArrangement` class is responsible for arranging a container with a fixed width and no height constraint. The failure context indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an invalid range where the l...

3. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrange(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,RectangleConstraint)** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrange(BlockContainer, Graphics2D, RectangleConstraint)` supports hypothesis H1. The failure context indicates that the `RectangleConstraint` is initialized with a fixed width constrai...

4. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.BorderArrangement()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.BorderArrangement()` is a default constructor that initializes a new instance of `BorderArrangement` without invoking any other methods or performing calculations related to width const...

5. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.add(Block,Object)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.add(Block,Object)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure through incorrect handling of block assignments to specific edges, which could affect the overall ar...

6. **org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.clear()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.clear()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it simply resets the layout by nullifying block references without affecting width constraint calculations. Since it d...
