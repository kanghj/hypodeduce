"org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrangeFF(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,RectangleConstraint)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `arrangeFF` in the `BorderArrangement` class is responsible for arranging items within a container based on the provided constraints. The failure context indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an invalid range where the lower bound is greater than the upper bound. This suggests that the method may incorrectly calculate or handle the width constraint, as the `RectangleConstraint` is initialized with a fixed width of 10.0, but the resulting range has an upper bound of -2.3. This discrepancy supports hypothesis H1, as it indicates a potential flaw in how the method processes or applies the width constraint, leading to improper sizing."
"org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrangeFN(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,double)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `arrangeFN` in the `BorderArrangement` class is responsible for arranging a container with a fixed width and no height constraint. The failure context indicates an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an invalid range where the lower bound is greater than the upper bound. This suggests that the method may incorrectly calculate or handle the width constraint, as it attempts to arrange components within a fixed width, potentially leading to negative or invalid size calculations. The method's reliance on fixed width without proper validation or adjustment of component sizes supports hypothesis H1, as it could result in improper sizing and invalid range values."
"org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrange(BlockContainer,Graphics2D,RectangleConstraint)",0.806842,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.arrange(BlockContainer, Graphics2D, RectangleConstraint)` supports hypothesis H1. The failure context indicates that the `RectangleConstraint` is initialized with a fixed width constraint of 10.0, but the stack trace shows an `IllegalArgumentException` due to an invalid range where the lower bound (0.0) is greater than the upper bound (-2.3). This suggests that the method may incorrectly calculate or handle the width constraint, leading to improper sizing and an invalid range, which aligns with the hypothesis that the failure is due to incorrect handling of width constraints within the `BorderArrangement` class."
org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.BorderArrangement(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.BorderArrangement()` is a default constructor that initializes a new instance of `BorderArrangement` without invoking any other methods or performing calculations related to width constraints. This suggests that the constructor itself does not directly contribute to the failure described in hypothesis H1. The issue likely arises from subsequent methods, such as `arrangeFF` or `arrangeFN`, where the width constraint is improperly handled, as indicated by the `IllegalArgumentException` related to the `Range` object with an invalid lower and upper bound."
"org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.add(Block,Object)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.add(Block,Object)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure through incorrect handling of block assignments to specific edges, which could affect the overall arrangement and sizing calculations. Since the method assigns blocks to fields without invoking other methods, any misassignment or miscalculation of block dimensions at this stage could propagate errors in subsequent arrangement methods like `arrangeFF` and `arrangeFN`. The failure context indicates a `Range` error, suggesting that improper block placement or dimension handling in `add` might lead to invalid range calculations during arrangement."
org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.clear(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by an incorrect calculation or handling of the width constraint within the `BorderArrangement` class, leading to improper sizing of chart components.",org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement (HH1),"The method `org.jfree.chart.block.BorderArrangement.clear()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it simply resets the layout by nullifying block references without affecting width constraint calculations. Since it does not involve any calculations or handling of constraints, it neither contributes to nor resolves the improper sizing issue described in the failure context. The failure likely arises elsewhere in the `BorderArrangement` class, specifically in methods that handle constraint calculations, such as `arrangeFF` or `arrangeFN`."
