"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource(Node,Format,boolean,int,SourceMap,DetailLevel,Charset,boolean)",0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testNumericKeys"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter.toSource` is responsible for converting a syntax tree into JavaScript code, which includes handling and formatting of numeric keys. If there was a recent change in this method affecting how numeric keys are processed, it could lead to discrepancies like those observed in the test failure. Specifically, the test failure indicates that the numeric key '010' is being interpreted as an octal number (8) instead of a string, suggesting a possible alteration in the method's logic for distinguishing between numeric and string keys. This supports Hypothesis H2, as the method's role in formatting could directly impact the test output."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build(),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.build()` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for generating the source code by determining the output format and invoking the `toSource` method with specific parameters. If there was a recent change in how `toSource` processes numeric keys, it could directly affect the output format of object literals, leading to the observed test failure. The fact that the test expected a string key ""010"" but received a numeric key 10 suggests that the handling of numeric keys might have been altered, possibly due to changes in the logic within `toSource` or its configuration parameters."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.append(String)` simply appends strings and updates line length, without altering the content or format of the strings. It does not process or interpret numeric keys in object literals, so it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in handling numeric keys likely originates elsewhere in the codebase, as this method's functionality is limited to string concatenation and does not involve logic that could affect numeric key formatting."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testNumericKeys"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getCode()` simply returns the current code as a string from its internal `StringBuilder` and does not involve any logic for handling or formatting numeric keys. Since it does not call any other methods or perform any transformations, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2 directly. The discrepancy in the expected output is likely due to changes elsewhere in the codebase that affect how numeric keys are processed before reaching this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.startSourceMapping(Node)` primarily deals with source mapping and does not directly handle or format numeric keys in object literals. Since it focuses on managing source mapping positions and does not interact with the logic for printing or formatting object keys, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1. The failure in the test is more likely related to changes in the code responsible for formatting object literals rather than source mapping."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.endSourceMapping(Node)` is primarily concerned with managing source mapping information, specifically by popping the mapping from the stack and recording its end position. It does not directly handle or format numeric keys in object literals. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with the code responsible for formatting or handling numeric keys. The failure in the test is more likely related to changes elsewhere in the codebase that affect how numeric keys are processed or printed, rather than the source mapping functionality."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$Builder.setPrettyPrint(boolean)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 because it only controls the formatting style (pretty printing) of the output and does not affect the logic for handling or formatting numeric keys in object literals. The failure in the test is due to the interpretation of numeric keys, specifically the conversion of the string ""010"" to the number 10, which is independent of whether pretty printing is enabled or disabled. Therefore, the method does not support or contradict H1, as it does not influence the underlying logic that caused the test failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$CompactCodePrinter.maybeCutLine(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinterTest::testNumericKeys"" may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys in object literals, leading to incorrect output or unexpected behavior during the test.",,"The method `maybeCutLine()` is primarily concerned with managing line length by inserting line breaks, and it does not directly handle or format numeric keys in object literals. Since it does not interact with the logic responsible for parsing or printing numeric keys, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1. The failure in `testNumericKeys` is more likely related to changes in the codebase that affect how numeric keys are interpreted or printed, rather than line length management."

Since it does not interact with or modify the logic for processing numeric keys, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2. The failure in ""testNumericKeys"" is more likely related to changes elsewhere in the codebase that specifically affect how numeric keys are interpreted or printed, rather than line break preferences."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CodePrinter$MappedCodePrinter.getLastChar(),0.200000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the handling or formatting of numeric keys, leading to discrepancies in the expected output during the test.",,"The method `getLastChar()` simply returns the last character of the code or '\0' if the code is empty, without altering or formatting numeric keys. This method does not interact with or modify the handling of numeric keys, thus it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H5. The discrepancy in the test output is likely unrelated to this method, as it does not involve any logic that could affect the formatting of numeric keys."
