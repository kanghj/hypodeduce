# GPT-only Results for Mockito-2

## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.mockito.internal.util.Timer.Timer(long)** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: H1: The test may be failing because the method being tested does not correctly handle negative duration values, leading to an unexpected exception or behavior. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.util.Timer (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.internal.util.Timer.Timer(long)` directly sets the `durationMillis` field to the provided value without any validation or exception handling for negative values. This supports hypothesis H1, as the constructor doe...

2. **org.mockito.Mockito.after(long)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H4: The test may be failing because the method under test does not correctly handle negative duration values, leading to an unexpected exception or behavior. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.Mockito (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.Mockito.after(long)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H4, as it is designed for verifying interactions over a specified period and does not directly interact with the logic of handling negative duration values in th...

3. **org.mockito.Mockito.timeout(long)** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The test may be failing because the method being tested does not correctly handle negative duration values, leading to an unexpected exception or behavior. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.Mockito (HH3).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.Mockito.timeout(long)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 because it is used for verifying interactions with a timeout in concurrent conditions, rather than handling or validating input values like negative duratio...
