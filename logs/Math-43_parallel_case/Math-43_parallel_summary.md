## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `setMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic meanImpl)` supports hypothesis H1 because it requires the mean implementation to be set before any data is added to `SummaryStatistics`. In the test, `setMeanImpl` is called before add...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getMean()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getMean()` directly returns the result of the `meanImpl` statistic, which in this case is an instance of `Mean`. The failure suggests that `stats.getMean()` returns `...

3. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.addValue(double)** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.addValue(double)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the overridden mean calculation method (`meanImpl`) is not being incremented if it is not set correctly or...

4. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure could be due to the timing of when the mean implementation is set. The method requires that the geometric mean implementation...

5. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.SummaryStatistics()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.SummaryStatistics()` constructs a new `SummaryStatistics` instance without initializing the mean calculation method, which supports hypothesis H1. Since the mean impl...

6. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.checkEmpty()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.checkEmpty()` contradicts hypothesis H1. The method throws an `IllegalStateException` if `n > 0`, indicating that it is designed to ensure no values are added before ...

7. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getGeometricMean()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getGeometricMean()` directly returns the result of the `geoMeanImpl` statistic without invoking other methods, indicating that it relies solely on the implementation ...

8. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getVariance()** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getVariance()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it pertains to variance calculation rather than mean calculation. The failure in the test is ...

9. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setVarianceImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)** — score 0.100. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `setVarianceImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)` supports hypothesis H1 by highlighting the importance of setting the statistical implementation before adding data, as it checks if the data set is empty using `checkEmpty()`. Th...
