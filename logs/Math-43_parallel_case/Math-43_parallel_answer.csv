org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `setMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic meanImpl)` supports hypothesis H1 because it requires the mean implementation to be set before any data is added to `SummaryStatistics`. In the test, `setMeanImpl` is called before adding values, which aligns with the method's requirement. However, the failure suggests that the overridden mean calculation might not handle the input data as expected, resulting in `NaN` instead of the expected mean value. This indicates a potential mismatch between the expected behavior of the overridden method and its actual implementation or input handling."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getMean(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getMean()` directly returns the result of the `meanImpl` statistic, which in this case is an instance of `Mean`. The failure suggests that `stats.getMean()` returns `NaN`, indicating that the `Mean` implementation might not have been correctly updated with the input data, or it might not handle the data as expected. This supports hypothesis H1, as the mismatch could be due to incorrect assumptions about how `Mean` processes the data or updates its internal state when used in conjunction with `SummaryStatistics`."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.addValue(double),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.addValue(double)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the overridden mean calculation method (`meanImpl`) is not being incremented if it is not set correctly or if it defaults to a non-operational state. Since `meanImpl` is conditionally incremented only if it is not the default implementation, any mismatch or incorrect assumption about its initialization or state could lead to it not being updated, resulting in `NaN` when `getMean()` is called. This behavior aligns with the failure context where the expected mean value is not computed, suggesting a potential issue with how `meanImpl` is set or utilized."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `setGeoMeanImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure could be due to the timing of when the mean implementation is set. The method requires that the geometric mean implementation be set before any data is added using `addValue(double)`, as setting it afterward will result in an `IllegalStateException`. In the test case, `setMeanImpl(new Mean())` is called before adding values, which aligns with the method's requirement, suggesting that the issue might not be with the timing but potentially with the assumptions about the `Mean` class's behavior or input data handling."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.SummaryStatistics(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.SummaryStatistics()` constructs a new `SummaryStatistics` instance without initializing the mean calculation method, which supports hypothesis H1. Since the mean implementation is set later using `setMeanImpl(new Mean())`, any mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method could arise from incorrect assumptions about how `Mean` handles input data, such as not accounting for cases where no values have been added yet, leading to a `NaN` result. The failure occurs because the `Mean` class's `evaluate` method might not handle empty or uninitialized data as expected, resulting in a `NaN` instead of the anticipated mean value."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.checkEmpty(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.checkEmpty()` contradicts hypothesis H1. The method throws an `IllegalStateException` if `n > 0`, indicating that it is designed to ensure no values are added before configuring the statistic. In the test, values are added after setting the mean implementation, so `checkEmpty()` would not be triggered. The failure is due to `stats.getMean()` returning `NaN`, suggesting the mean calculation was not properly configured or executed, rather than a mismatch in expected behavior of the overridden method."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getGeometricMean(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getGeometricMean()` directly returns the result of the `geoMeanImpl` statistic without invoking other methods, indicating that it relies solely on the implementation provided by `geoMeanImpl`. This supports hypothesis H1, as any mismatch in expected versus actual behavior would stem from the `geoMeanImpl` implementation itself, such as incorrect handling of input data or assumptions about its calculation logic. In the context of the test, if `geoMeanImpl` does not correctly compute the geometric mean for the given scores, it would result in a discrepancy between expected and actual values, similar to the issue observed with the mean calculation."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getVariance(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.getVariance()` does not directly support or contradict hypothesis H1, as it pertains to variance calculation rather than mean calculation. The failure in the test is related to the mean calculation, where `stats.getMean()` returns `NaN`, indicating an issue with how the mean is computed or initialized, not with variance. Since `getVariance()` does not interact with the mean calculation or its implementation, it does not provide evidence for or against the hypothesis regarding the overridden mean method's behavior."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics.setVarianceImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of the overridden mean calculation method in the Math class, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about its implementation or input data handling.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics (HH1),"The method `setVarianceImpl(StorelessUnivariateStatistic)` supports hypothesis H1 by highlighting the importance of setting the statistical implementation before adding data, as it checks if the data set is empty using `checkEmpty()`. This suggests that if `setMeanImpl(new Mean())` was called after data was added, it could lead to unexpected behavior, such as returning `NaN` instead of the expected mean. The failure in the test might be due to a similar issue where the overridden mean calculation method was not properly set before data was added, leading to a mismatch in expected and actual results."
