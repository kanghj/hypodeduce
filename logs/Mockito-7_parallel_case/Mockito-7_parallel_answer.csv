org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.extractRawTypeOf(Type),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",,"The method `extractRawTypeOf(Type)` supports Hypothesis H1 by highlighting the issue with handling raw types in generic structures. The method attempts to extract the raw `Class<?>` from a given `Type`, but it throws an exception when encountering unsupported types, such as `null`. In the failure context, the error occurs because the method encounters a `TypeVariable` that cannot be resolved to a raw type, likely due to the use of raw types in the test (`myMock1.getNested().getNested().returnSomething()`), which leads to incorrect deep stubbing behavior. This aligns with the hypothesis that a type mismatch due to raw types is causing the failure."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.getActualTypeArgumentFor(TypeVariable),0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.getActualTypeArgumentFor(TypeVariable)` supports Hypothesis H1. The method attempts to retrieve the actual type argument for a given type variable, and if it encounters a raw type, it recursively calls itself. In the failure context, the error ""Raw extraction not supported for: 'null'"" suggests that the method encountered a raw type without a corresponding actual type argument, leading to a failure in deep stubbing. This aligns with the hypothesis that a type mismatch due to raw types in the test caused the incorrect behavior."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.inferFrom(Type),0.806842,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.inferFrom(Type)` supports Hypothesis H1. It only supports `Class` and `ParameterizedType`, and throws an exception for other types, such as raw types. In the test, the use of raw types in the method chain (`myMock1.getNested().getNested().returnSomething()`) likely leads to a type mismatch, causing the deep stubbing to fail when `inferFrom(Type)` encounters a raw type and cannot extract the necessary generic type information, resulting in the observed exception."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.rawType(),0.804526,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",,"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.rawType()` supports Hypothesis H1 by attempting to extract the raw type of a type variable, which is crucial when dealing with generics. In the failure context, the error ""Raw extraction not supported for: 'null'"" suggests that the method `extractRawTypeOf(typeVariable)` was unable to determine a raw type due to the use of raw types in the test. This aligns with the hypothesis that a type mismatch, caused by handling generic nested structures as raw types, leads to incorrect deep stubbing behavior. The method's reliance on correctly identifying raw types underscores the importance of proper generic type handling to avoid such failures."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.boundsOf(TypeVariable),0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual types due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.boundsOf(TypeVariable)` supports Hypothesis H3 by highlighting the issue with raw types. When the method encounters a TypeVariable, it attempts to resolve its bounds recursively. If the first bound is another TypeVariable, it continues the recursion; otherwise, it returns a `TypeVarBoundedType`. In the failure context, the error occurs because the method cannot resolve the raw type of a `null` value, indicating a mismatch between expected and actual types due to raw type usage. This aligns with H3, as the raw type extraction failure suggests incorrect deep stubbing behavior stemming from type mismatches."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.registerTypeVariablesOn(Type),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)` supports Hypothesis H1 by highlighting the importance of correctly handling type variables and their actual type arguments, especially in the context of generics. In the failure context, the use of raw types (e.g., `MyClass1` without specifying generic parameters) can lead to a situation where the method cannot properly register or resolve type variables, as it expects a `ParameterizedType` with specific type arguments. This mismatch can cause the deep stubbing mechanism to fail when it encounters a `null` or unexpected type, as indicated by the stack trace pointing to issues with extracting raw types."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.resolveGenericReturnType(Method),0.800000,H5,0.700000,"Hypothesis H5: The test may be failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual types when deep stubbing is applied to a generic class that is used as a raw type, leading to incorrect method invocation or return values.",org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport.resolveGenericReturnType(Method)` supports Hypothesis H5 by attempting to resolve the generic return type of a method, which is crucial when dealing with generics in deep stubbing. In the failure context, the method `getNested()` is likely returning a generic type that is being treated as a raw type, leading to a mismatch. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs during the extraction of the raw type, suggesting that the method's inability to correctly resolve the generic return type when used as a raw type contributes to the incorrect method invocation or return values, aligning with the hypothesis."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.extractActualBoundedTypeOf(Type),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",,"The method `extractActualBoundedTypeOf(Type)` supports Hypothesis H1 by attempting to resolve the actual bounded type of a given `Type`, which is crucial when dealing with generics. In the failure context, the error occurs because the method encounters a `TypeVariable` that cannot be resolved to a concrete type, leading to a ""Raw extraction not supported"" exception. This suggests that the use of raw types in the test code may indeed cause a type mismatch, as the method relies on resolving type variables to their bounded types to perform deep stubbing correctly. The recursive nature of the method indicates it expects fully specified generic types, which aligns with the hypothesis that raw types disrupt this process."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.rawExtraInterfaces(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",,"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.rawExtraInterfaces()` supports Hypothesis H1 by highlighting the issue of raw type extraction. It attempts to extract raw interface types from a generic type, which can lead to failures when the type is not explicitly defined, as seen in the stack trace where `extractRawTypeOf` fails due to a `null` value. This indicates that the use of raw types in the test may indeed cause a type mismatch, resulting in incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures."
org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.readTypeVariables(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types in the test, leading to incorrect deep stubbing behavior when handling generic nested structures.",,"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.reflection.GenericMetadataSupport$TypeVariableReturnType.readTypeVariables()` supports Hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure may indeed be caused by a type mismatch due to the use of raw types. The method attempts to register type variables for each bound and actual type argument of the type variable. If a raw type is used, it may not provide the necessary type information for `registerTypeVariablesOn(Type)` to function correctly, leading to the ""Raw extraction not supported"" error. This suggests that the deep stubbing mechanism fails when it encounters a raw type, as it cannot resolve the generic type information needed for proper stubbing."
