"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyAccess(JSType,String,NodeTraversal,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `checkPropertyAccess` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in emitting warnings when a property cannot be defined on an object. In the test case `testIssue1047`, the method likely checks if the property `prop` can be defined on `C2`, and due to a recent change in type inference logic, it might incorrectly determine that `prop` is not definable on `C2`, leading to the unexpected type mismatch error. The method's logic of checking if a property cannot be defined aligns with the hypothesis that a change in type inference could cause such an error."

In the test failure, the method likely checks if the property `prop` exists on the type `C2`, and since it doesn't, it emits a warning. If there was a recent change in type inference logic affecting how properties are checked or inferred, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the test failure where the property `prop` is incorrectly associated with `C3.c2_` instead of `C2`. This suggests that the method's behavior aligns with the hypothesis that a change in type inference could cause such mismatches."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitGetProp(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitGetProp(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` is responsible for handling property access on objects, such as `obj.prop`. In the failure context, the error arises from accessing a property `prop` on an instance of `C2`, which is not defined. The method's role in type checking and error reporting suggests it could be involved in the failure if recent changes in type inference logic affected how it determines the types of objects and their properties. If the method incorrectly infers the type of `this.c2_` or fails to recognize that `prop` is undefined due to a change, it would support Hypothesis H1."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node,boolean)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.check(Node, boolean)` supports hypothesis H1 as it involves type checking logic that could be affected by recent changes in type inference. The method creates a `NodeTraversal` and calls `traverseWithScope`, which is central to type inference and checking. If there were recent changes in how `traverseWithScope` or `inferJSDocInfo.process` handle nodes, especially regarding private properties or constructor annotations, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the failure where `C3.c2_` is incorrectly flagged instead of `C2`."

It utilizes `getJSType` to determine the type of a node and `report` to flag issues, which suggests that any recent changes in type inference logic affecting these operations could lead to unexpected type mismatches. In the failure context, the method might incorrectly handle the type of `this.c2_`, leading to the error message about the undefined property `prop` on `C3.c2_` instead of `C2`."

It handles NAME nodes by determining if they are typeable and retrieves or infers their types using `getJSType`. If a recent change affected how `getJSType` infers types, especially in edge cases, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the test failure where `this.c2_` was expected to have a property `prop` defined on `C2`, but the error message indicates a mismatch with `C3.c2_`. This suggests that the type inference logic might not be correctly associating the expected type with the NAME node."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType,String,JSDocInfo,JSType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to type mismatches through its validation of property inheritance and `@override` annotations. If recent changes in type inference logic affect how `hasUnknownOrEmptySupertype` is evaluated or how errors are reported, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches, as seen in the test failure. The method's role in checking inheritance correctness and reporting errors aligns with the observed issue where the property `prop` is incorrectly associated with `C3.c2_` instead of `C2`, suggesting a possible mishandling of type relationships."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyInheritanceOnGetpropAssign(NodeTraversal,Node,Node,String,JSDocInfo,JSType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkPropertyInheritanceOnGetpropAssign` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in verifying property inheritance during prototype assignments. If recent changes in type inference logic affect how this method evaluates conditions for calling `checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance`, it could lead to incorrect handling of edge cases, such as the one in `testIssue1047`. Specifically, the method's logic might not correctly account for the absence of the `prop` property on `C2`, resulting in the unexpected type mismatch error observed."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.getClosestPropertySuggestion(JSType,String)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue1047"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.getClosestPropertySuggestion(JSType,String)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to unexpected type mismatches. It attempts to find the closest property name suggestion using edit distance, which might lead to incorrect suggestions if the type inference logic has changed recently. In the failure context, the method could incorrectly suggest properties for `C3.c2_` instead of `C2`, indicating a possible mishandling of type inference for private properties or union types, aligning with the hypothesis of recent changes affecting edge cases."

If recent changes in type inference logic affected how property existence is determined, it could lead to incorrect handling of `this.c2_` as having an undefined property `prop`. This supports hypothesis H1, as the method's role in identifying property tests could be impacted by changes, causing unexpected type mismatches in edge cases like the one in `testIssue1047`."
