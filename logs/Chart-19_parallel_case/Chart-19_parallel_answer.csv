In the test, `assertEquals(-1, plot.getRangeAxisIndex(new NumberAxis(""Y2"")))` fails because a new `NumberAxis` instance with the same label ""Y2"" is not the same object as `rangeAxis2`, which was added to the plot. This indicates a mismatch between expected and actual index values due to object identity rather than label matching, supporting the hypothesis of incorrect setup or modification in the test environment."

In the test `testGetRangeAxisIndex`, the failure could be due to the `getRangeAxisIndex` method returning unexpected index values when the range axes are not correctly set up or modified, as seen when `plot.setRangeAxis(1, rangeAxis2)` is called, but `assertEquals(-1, plot.getRangeAxisIndex(new NumberAxis(""Y2""))` fails. This suggests that the test might not account for how new instances of `NumberAxis` with the same label are treated as distinct objects, leading to index mismatches."

However, if the internal state of the plot is not updated correctly or if a new `NumberAxis` with the same label (""Y2"") is not recognized as `rangeAxis2`, it could lead to unexpected index values, as seen when `getRangeAxisIndex(new NumberAxis(""Y2""))` returns -1 instead of 1. This indicates that the method might not handle new instances of axes with identical labels as expected, leading to the test failure."

If recent changes in the axis assignment logic altered how axes are mapped or indexed, this could lead to discrepancies between expected and actual indices, supporting hypothesis H2. Specifically, if the constructor or related methods like `setRangeAxisLocation` or `mapDatasetToDomainAxis` have been modified to change default axis assignments or mappings, it could result in the observed mismatch in range axis indices during the test."

This behavior supports Hypothesis H3, as any recent changes in the `getRangeAxis(int)` method affecting how axes are mapped or indexed could lead to incorrect index retrievals, as evidenced by the test failures. The test failures, such as returning -1 for an axis that should be mapped, suggest potential issues in the mapping logic, possibly introduced by recent code changes."

If a recent change affected how datasets are mapped to range axes, it could lead to incorrect index retrieval, as seen in the test failures. Specifically, the method's invocation of `datasetChanged(DatasetChangeEvent)` after mapping a dataset to a range axis index suggests that any changes in this logic could disrupt the expected behavior of `getRangeAxisIndex()`, resulting in the observed assertion failures."

However, if the axis is not properly configured or if the change listener is not correctly set, it might lead to unexpected behavior in `getRangeAxisIndex`, resulting in the failure. The failure to recognize a new `NumberAxis(""Y2"")` as the same axis could also indicate an issue with how axes are compared or stored internally."

If recent changes affected how datasets are associated with range axes, this could lead to unexpected indices being returned by `getRangeAxisIndex()`. For instance, if the mapping logic was altered such that datasets are incorrectly linked to range axes, the method would return unexpected results, causing the test to fail when it checks for specific axis indices."

If recent changes in the codebase modified how datasets are mapped to domain axes, it might have inadvertently impacted the logic for retrieving range axis indices, as both domain and range axes are part of the plot's axis management. The method's invocation of `datasetChanged(DatasetChangeEvent)` suggests that any changes in dataset-to-axis mapping could trigger updates that might not correctly reflect in the range axis index retrieval, especially if the logic for handling these updates was altered."
