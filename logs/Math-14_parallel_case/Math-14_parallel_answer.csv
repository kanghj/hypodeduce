org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.vector.Weight.Weight(double[]),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample"" could be caused by numerical instability or precision errors when handling large datasets or high-degree polynomials.",org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.vector.Weight (HH5),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.vector.Weight.Weight(double[])` creates a diagonal weight matrix from a given array of weights. This method supports hypothesis H1 as it involves creating a potentially large matrix when handling large datasets, which can lead to memory issues rather than numerical instability or precision errors. The failure occurs due to an `OutOfMemoryError`, indicating that the problem is more likely related to memory allocation for large matrices rather than numerical precision, as evidenced by the stack trace pointing to matrix creation functions."
