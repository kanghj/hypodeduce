org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createNumber(String),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtilsTest::testCreateNumber"" could be due to an unexpected input format that is not being correctly parsed by the `createNumber` method, leading to a parsing exception or incorrect number creation.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The failure in `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtilsTest::testCreateNumber` supports hypothesis H1, as the `createNumber` method attempts to parse the input string by examining type qualifiers ('f', 'F', 'd', 'D', 'l', 'L') at the end of the string. The `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests that the method may not be handling certain input formats correctly, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about the string length or structure when attempting to parse or substring the input. This indicates that unexpected input formats could indeed lead to parsing exceptions or incorrect number creation."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createDouble(String),0.808632,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases for numeric string inputs, such as leading zeros or unexpected characters, in the `createNumber` method.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createDouble(String)` method supports Hypothesis H4 as it directly converts a string to a Double without handling edge cases like leading zeros or unexpected characters, which could lead to exceptions. Since it does not call other methods that might handle such cases, any malformed input string could result in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, as seen in the stack trace. This indicates that `createNumber` might not be robust against edge cases, aligning with the hypothesis."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createFloat(String),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases for numeric string inputs, such as leading zeros or unexpected characters, in the `createNumber` method.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createFloat(String)` supports Hypothesis H4 as it directly converts a string to a `Float` without handling edge cases like leading zeros or unexpected characters, which could lead to exceptions if such cases are not properly managed. Since it does not call any other methods, any edge case handling must be implemented within this method itself. If `createFloat` is used within `createNumber`, and it fails to handle these edge cases, it could contribute to the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed in the failure context."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createInteger(String),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases for numeric string inputs, such as leading zeros or unexpected characters, in the `createNumber` method.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createInteger(String)` supports Hypothesis H4 as it specifically handles edge cases like hex and octal notations, which suggests that `createNumber` might fail if it does not correctly handle similar edge cases. The failure context indicates a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which could occur if `createNumber` improperly processes numeric strings with unexpected characters or formats, such as leading zeros or suffixes like 'D' or 'F'. This suggests that `createNumber` might not be as robust as `createInteger` in handling diverse numeric string inputs."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createBigDecimal(String),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtilsTest::testCreateNumber"" could be due to an unexpected input format that is not being correctly parsed by the `createNumber` method, leading to a parsing exception or incorrect number creation.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createBigDecimal(String)` supports hypothesis H1 as it highlights potential input format issues that could lead to exceptions. Specifically, it throws a `NumberFormatException` for blank strings, indicating that `createNumber` might also fail if it encounters unexpected or improperly formatted input. The failure in `testCreateNumber` with a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests that `createNumber` might not be handling certain string formats correctly, similar to how `createBigDecimal` explicitly handles blank strings."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createLong(String),0.300000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases for numeric string inputs, such as leading zeros or unexpected characters, in the `createNumber` method.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createLong(String)` supports Hypothesis H4 as it directly converts a string to a Long without handling edge cases like leading zeros or unexpected characters, which could lead to exceptions if such inputs are not properly validated. Since it returns null for null inputs and does not call other methods, it lacks comprehensive input validation, potentially causing failures when `createNumber` encounters edge cases. The stack trace indicates a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`, suggesting that improper handling of string indices, possibly due to unexpected characters or formats, is a contributing factor."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createBigInteger(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtilsTest::testCreateNumber"" could be due to an unexpected input format that is not being correctly parsed by the `createNumber` method, leading to a parsing exception or incorrect number creation.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createBigInteger(String)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly converts a string to a `BigInteger` and returns null for null inputs, indicating it expects a specific input format. If `createNumber` internally calls `createBigInteger` without properly handling unexpected formats, it could lead to exceptions like `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The failure in `testCreateNumber` suggests that `createNumber` might not be correctly parsing certain input strings, potentially due to assumptions about input format that are not met, leading to incorrect substring operations."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.isAllZeros(String),0.200000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of edge cases for numeric string inputs, such as leading zeros or unexpected characters, in the `createNumber` method.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.isAllZeros(String)` checks if a string is null or consists entirely of '0' characters, which suggests it is used to handle edge cases involving numeric strings with leading zeros. However, since the failure involves a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` in `createNumber`, it indicates that the issue is more likely related to incorrect substring operations rather than handling of leading zeros. Therefore, while `isAllZeros` might address some edge cases, it does not directly support hypothesis H4 regarding the specific failure observed."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.isDigits(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtilsTest::testCreateNumber"" could be due to an unexpected input format that is not being correctly parsed by the `createNumber` method, leading to a parsing exception or incorrect number creation.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.isDigits(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the `createNumber` method might not handle non-digit characters properly, as `isDigits` only verifies if a string contains purely digit characters. Since `createNumber` is expected to parse various numeric formats, including those with decimal points or scientific notation, the failure could arise from encountering unexpected characters or formats that `isDigits` would not validate as purely digits. This suggests that `createNumber` might not be robust against inputs that deviate from simple digit-only strings, leading to parsing exceptions like the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed."
