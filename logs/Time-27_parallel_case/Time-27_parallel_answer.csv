org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.parseMutablePeriod(String),0.810000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.parseMutablePeriod(String)` throws an `IllegalArgumentException` when the input text does not conform to the expected format, as seen in the stack trace with the malformed input ""PT1003199059S"". This suggests that the failure is due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats, supporting hypothesis H1. The method expects a specific format for parsing, and any deviation, such as incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting, would result in an exception, indicating that the issue likely arises from the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder` not aligning with the expected format."
org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.parsePeriod(String),0.808632,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.parsePeriod(String)` parses a period from a given text and returns a new Period object. The failure occurs due to an `IllegalArgumentException` when parsing the string ""PT1003199059S"", indicating that the format is malformed at ""1003199059S"". This suggests that the issue is not related to locale-specific formatting but rather to the handling of large numeric values in the period string, which contradicts hypothesis H1. The method does not involve locale-specific logic, and the error arises from the numeric value exceeding expected limits, not from locale mismatches."
org.joda.time.format.ISOPeriodFormat.standard(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.ISOPeriodFormat (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.ISOPeriodFormat.standard()` constructs a `PeriodFormatter` using the standard ISO format, which includes fields for years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, but does not output milliseconds. The failure in `testBug2495455` involves parsing a period string ""PT1003199059S"", which suggests a mismatch in handling large second values rather than locale-specific formatting. The `standard()` method does not involve locale-specific formatting, thus it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as the issue seems unrelated to locale handling and more about the format's ability to parse large values correctly."
"org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.PeriodFormatter(PeriodPrinter,PeriodParser)",0.300000,H5,0.700000,"The failure might be caused by an incorrect handling of locale-specific formatting rules within the `PeriodFormatterBuilder`, leading to unexpected output when parsing or formatting periods.",org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.PeriodFormatter(PeriodPrinter, PeriodParser)` initializes the formatter with a given printer and parser but does not directly handle locale-specific formatting rules. Since it does not invoke any other methods that might process locale-specific logic, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H5. The failure in parsing ""PT1003199059S"" suggests an issue with the parsing logic rather than locale-specific formatting, as the constructor itself does not engage with locale handling."
org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.getParser(),0.300000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.getParser()` returns the internal `PeriodParser` instance used for parsing period strings. Since it does not involve any locale-specific logic or call other methods that handle locale-specific formatting, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1. The failure is more likely due to the format string ""PT1003199059S"" being malformed, as indicated by the exception, rather than a locale-specific issue."
org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.checkParser(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.checkParser()` ensures that a valid parser is available before attempting to parse a period string. In the failure context, the method does not directly address locale-specific formatting issues, as it primarily checks for the presence of a parser rather than validating format compatibility. The exception thrown (`IllegalArgumentException`) indicates a malformed input rather than a missing parser, suggesting that the issue is more likely related to the input format ""PT1003199059S"" not matching the expected pattern, rather than a locale-specific formatting mismatch."
org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.getPrinter(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual output formats due to incorrect handling of locale-specific period formatting in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder`.,org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.format.PeriodFormatter.getPrinter()` returns the internal `PeriodPrinter` instance used for formatting periods, but it does not directly handle locale-specific formatting. Since the failure involves parsing a malformed period string (""PT1003199059S""), the issue is likely not related to the `getPrinter()` method itself, as it does not influence parsing or locale-specific behavior. Instead, the problem may stem from the `PeriodFormatterBuilder` configuration or parsing logic, which is not addressed by `getPrinter()`."
