# GPT-only Results for Mockito-28

## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMockCandidate(Class,Set,Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `injectMockCandidate` supports hypothesis H1 as it iterates over instance fields of a class, ordering them with supertypes last. This ordering suggests that the method prioritizes exact type matches over ancestor types, aligni...

2. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMocksOnFields(Set,Set,Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `injectMocksOnFields` supports Hypothesis H1 because it processes fields annotated with `@InjectMocks` by iterating over them and ordering from sub-type to super-type. This suggests that the method prioritizes exact type match...

3. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.FinalMockCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(Collection,Field,Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.FinalMockCandidateFilter (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `filterCandidate` supports hypothesis H1 because it prioritizes injection based on the number of mock candidates rather than explicitly checking for exact type matches first. When there is exactly one mock, it attempts to inje...

4. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.TypeBasedCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(Collection,Field,Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.TypeBasedCandidateFilter (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.TypeBasedCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` supports hypothesis H1. It filters mocks by checking if their type is assignable to the field's type, which means it considers both exact ...

5. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine.injectMocks(Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine.injectMocks(Object)` is responsible for initializing mock dependencies for fields annotated with `@InjectMocks`. The failure context suggests that the mock was inje...

6. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine.processInjectMocks(Class,Object)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure might be caused by the injection mechanism incorrectly prioritizing ancestor types over exact type matches, leading to improper mock injection. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.InjectingAnnotationEngine (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `processInjectMocks` iterates through the class hierarchy and performs mock injection for fields annotated with `@InjectMocks`. This supports hypothesis H1 because the method's approach of traversing the class hierarchy could ...

7. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.NameBasedCandidateFilter.filterCandidate(Collection,Field,Object)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a misconfiguration in the dependency injection logic, where the mock is incorrectly injected into a superclass or interface instead of the most specific subclass. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.NameBasedCandidateFilter (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.injection.NameBasedCandidateFilter.filterCandidate` supports hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the misconfiguration in dependency injection. It filters mock objects based on name ...
