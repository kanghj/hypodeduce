org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Object),0.900000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testAddNonComparable"" may be caused by the method incorrectly attempting to compare non-comparable objects, leading to a ClassCastException or similar runtime error.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Object)` supports Hypothesis H1. The method attempts to cast the input object `v` to `Comparable<?>` using `(Comparable<?>) v`, which will throw a `ClassCastException` if `v` is not an instance of `Comparable`. This aligns with the failure context where a `ClassCastException` occurs when a non-Comparable object is added, indicating that the method incorrectly attempts to compare non-comparable objects, leading to the runtime error observed in the test."
org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.Frequency(),0.200000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testAddNonComparable"" may be caused by the method incorrectly attempting to compare non-comparable objects, leading to a ClassCastException or similar runtime error.",org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.Frequency()` initializes the frequency table using a `TreeMap`, which inherently requires keys to be `Comparable`. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure occurs when non-comparable objects are added, leading to a `ClassCastException` when the `TreeMap` attempts to compare these objects. The test case `testAddNonComparable` demonstrates this by adding a non-comparable `Object`, triggering the exception due to the `TreeMap`'s requirement for comparable keys."
