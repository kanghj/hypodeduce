If the algorithm encounters degenerate vertices or cycles, it could lead to non-termination or incorrect results, supporting hypothesis H1. The method's reliance on pivot operations without explicit anti-cycling measures, such as Bland's Rule, suggests it may not handle these edge cases robustly, potentially causing the failure observed in the test `testMath781`."

If the failure in `testMath781` is due to incorrect handling of edge cases, such as degenerate vertices or cycling, this method could support Hypothesis H1 by not adequately resolving these issues, potentially leading to non-termination or incorrect results. The method throws exceptions like `NoFeasibleSolutionException` and `UnboundedSolutionException`, indicating that it attempts to handle such edge cases, but if these exceptions are not properly managed or if the algorithm does not account for cycling, it could result in the observed test failure."

This setup directly influences how the algorithm handles precision and convergence, which are critical in edge cases like degenerate vertices or cycling. If these parameters are not appropriately set, it could lead to non-termination or incorrect results, supporting Hypothesis H1. The failure in `testMath781` might be due to inadequate handling of these edge cases, as the method does not invoke other methods that might address such issues, potentially leading to the observed assertion failure."

The method increments an iteration counter and selects a pivot column, which are critical steps in the Simplex algorithm. If the pivot selection logic does not adequately handle degeneracy or cycling, it could lead to non-termination or incorrect results, as suggested by the failure in the test case. Additionally, the method throws exceptions for unbounded solutions and iteration limits, indicating that it might not handle all edge cases gracefully, aligning with the hypothesis of incorrect edge case handling."

It selects the pivot column based on the most negative coefficient in the objective function row, which might not adequately address scenarios like degenerate vertices or cycling. If the tableau has multiple columns with similar negative coefficients or if the tableau is degenerate, this method might repeatedly select the same pivot column, leading to cycling or non-termination, thus supporting the hypothesis of incorrect handling of edge cases."

If this method incorrectly handles edge cases such as degenerate vertices, it could lead to incorrect pivot row selection, potentially causing cycling or non-termination. In the context of the test failure, if the constraints or objective function lead to degenerate solutions, the method's handling of ties or precision issues in MRT could support Hypothesis H1 by resulting in incorrect or suboptimal solutions."

This default initialization could potentially contribute to the failure in handling edge cases like degenerate vertices or cycling, as these scenarios often require careful tuning of precision parameters to ensure correct termination and results. Since the test `testMath781` involves constraints that could lead to such edge cases, the default settings might not be adequate, supporting hypothesis H1."
