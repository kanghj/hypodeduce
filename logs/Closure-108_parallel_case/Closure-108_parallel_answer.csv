"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.hotSwapScript(Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testIssue1144"" could be due to a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.hotSwapScript(Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H1. It creates a `Traversal` instance and uses `NodeTraversal.traverse` to process the AST, which suggests that any recent changes in aliasing logic affecting scope resolution could lead to errors during traversal. The method checks for errors post-traversal, and the presence of an `IllegalStateException` indicates that the aliasing logic might not be correctly resolving aliases, aligning with the hypothesis that recent changes could have introduced issues in scope resolution."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$AliasedTypeNode.applyAlias(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testIssue1144"" could be due to a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$AliasedTypeNode.applyAlias()` supports hypothesis H1 by directly dealing with alias resolution, where it replaces a type node's string value with a fully qualified name. The failure in `testIssue1144` could be due to this method incorrectly handling scope resolution, as it ensures the type name starts with the alias name. If a recent change altered how `applyAlias()` determines or applies the alias, it might lead to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases, as suggested by the stack trace indicating an `IllegalStateException` during alias application."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.ScopedAliases(AbstractCompiler,PreprocessorSymbolTable,AliasTransformationHandler)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles nested or complex alias structures, leading to unresolved or misresolved references during compilation.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.ScopedAliases(AbstractCompiler, PreprocessorSymbolTable, AliasTransformationHandler)` initializes the `ScopedAliases` instance by setting up the necessary components for alias processing, including the compiler, symbol table, and transformation handler. This setup is crucial for managing alias transformations during compilation. The failure context suggests an issue with alias application (`applyAlias` method), which could be influenced by how these components are initialized and interact. If recent changes affected how nested or complex alias structures are processed, this constructor's role in setting up the aliasing environment could indirectly contribute to the failure, supporting hypothesis H2."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.process(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testIssue1144"" could be due to a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 because it directly calls `hotSwapScript(Node, Node)` with the root node and null, indicating that any recent changes in `hotSwapScript` could affect alias resolution. Since the stack trace shows the failure occurring in `hotSwapScript`, it suggests that the aliasing logic within this method might be incorrectly handling scope resolution, leading to the observed failure. The call flow from `process` to `hotSwapScript` implies that any issues in alias handling would propagate through this delegation."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.enterScope(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testIssue1144"" could be due to a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.enterScope(NodeTraversal)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its role in handling scope resolution and alias transformation. When entering a new scope, it checks if the parent node is a call to the scope method and logs the alias transformation, which suggests it is directly involved in managing how aliases are resolved. If there was a recent change in this logic, it could lead to incorrect alias handling, as evidenced by the failure in `testIssue1144`, where the alias `sub.C` might not be resolved correctly. The method's reliance on `findAliases(NodeTraversal)` further indicates its critical role in alias resolution, supporting the hypothesis that changes here could cause the observed failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.exitScope(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliasesTest::testIssue1144"" could be due to a recent change in the aliasing logic that incorrectly handles scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases.",,"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ScopedAliases$Traversal.exitScope(NodeTraversal)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its handling of scope depth and alias resolution. Specifically, when the scope depth is exactly 2, the method renames namespace shadows and clears alias and forbidden locals, which could lead to incorrect alias resolution if recent changes altered how these operations are performed. The failure in `testIssue1144` might be linked to this logic if the aliasing process does not correctly reset or manage transformations, resulting in unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases."

It is responsible for iterating over variables in the current scope and identifying alias variables, which directly relates to scope resolution and alias handling. If there was a recent change in this method's logic, it could lead to incorrect alias resolution, as it records alias variables and rewrites declarations. The failure in `testIssue1144` could be due to this method not correctly handling the aliasing logic, resulting in unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases, as indicated by the stack trace pointing to `applyAlias` and `hotSwapScript` methods in `ScopedAliases`."

If recent changes in the aliasing logic affected how nested or complex alias structures are handled, this method could return an incomplete or incorrect list of alias usages, leading to unresolved or improperly resolved aliases. The stack trace indicates an `IllegalStateException` in `applyAlias`, suggesting that the alias usages collected might not align with expected alias resolutions, supporting the hypothesis of a recent change affecting alias handling."

The method specifically prevents traversal into functions unless they are identified as `goog.scope` functions using `isCallToScopeMethod(Node)`. If a recent change altered how `isCallToScopeMethod(Node)` identifies `goog.scope` functions, it could lead to incorrect alias resolution by either skipping necessary traversals or incorrectly traversing non-scope functions, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to changes in aliasing logic affecting scope resolution."

If there was a recent change in the aliasing logic affecting scope resolution, this method would be directly involved in identifying such issues by checking the correctness of the `goog.scope` parameters and their usage. The failure in `testIssue1144` could be due to this method not correctly validating the scope resolution, leading to unresolved or incorrectly resolved aliases, as indicated by the stack trace showing involvement of `ScopedAliases.applyAlias` and `ScopedAliases.hotSwapScript`."
