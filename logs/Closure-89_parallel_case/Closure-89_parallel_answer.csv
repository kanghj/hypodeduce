"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.CollapseProperties(AbstractCompiler,boolean,boolean)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `CollapseProperties.CollapseProperties(AbstractCompiler, boolean, boolean)` initializes the property collapsing process with specific configurations, such as whether to collapse properties on extern types and whether to inline aliases. If a recent change in the codebase modified these configuration flags or the logic within this constructor, it could have altered how properties are collapsed, particularly affecting functions in local scopes. This aligns with Hypothesis H1, as the failure in the test suggests that the property `a.b` was incorrectly collapsed to `a$b`, indicating a potential misconfiguration or logic error introduced by recent changes."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.collapseDeclarationOfNameAndDescendants(Name,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `collapseDeclarationOfNameAndDescendants` is designed to collapse properties of global names and their descendants, focusing on names that can be collapsed. The failure in the test suggests that the method might incorrectly handle functions in local scopes by collapsing properties that should remain uncollapsed, as indicated by the unexpected transformation of `a.b` to `a$b`. This behavior aligns with hypothesis H1, as the method's logic for collapsing properties could have been altered by a recent change, leading to the incorrect handling observed in the test case. The method's recursive nature and focus on global names might not account for local scope nuances, supporting the hypothesis that a recent change affected its behavior."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenNameRef(String,Node,Node,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenNameRef` supports hypothesis H1 by directly altering how property accesses are transformed into flattened names, which could affect property collapsing behavior. In the failure context, the expected output retains the property `a.b`, while the result shows `a$b`, indicating that the method might have incorrectly flattened the property access due to recent changes. The method's role in replacing `GETPROP` nodes with `NAME` nodes and updating annotations suggests it could be responsible for the unexpected transformation observed in the test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenNameRefAtDepth(String,Node,int,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `flattenNameRefAtDepth` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly deals with the flattening of name references, which is central to property collapsing. The failure context indicates an issue with how properties are collapsed in local scopes, as seen in the test output where `a.b` is incorrectly transformed to `a$b`. The method's role in traversing and flattening qualified names suggests that any recent changes to its logic or the conditions under which it operates could lead to the observed incorrect handling, aligning with the hypothesis that a recent codebase change affected property collapsing behavior."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenPrefixes(String,Name,int)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenPrefixes(String,Name,int)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly manipulates the structure of property names by flattening them, which could lead to incorrect handling if recent changes altered its behavior. The method recursively processes names starting at a specified depth, and if a recent change affected how it identifies or processes function names in local scopes, it could result in the observed failure. The failure context shows that the expected output maintains the original property structure (`a.b`), while the result shows a flattened structure (`a$b`), indicating that the method's behavior might have been altered to incorrectly flatten properties in local scopes."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenReferencesTo(Name,String)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `flattenReferencesTo(Name n, String alias)` is designed to flatten references to a collapsible property of a global name, except for its initial definition. This behavior aligns with the observed test failure, where the property `a.b` was incorrectly collapsed to `a$b`, suggesting that the method might have been applied inappropriately to a function in a local scope. The hypothesis H1 is supported by the fact that the method's logic assumes global scope properties, and any recent changes that inadvertently applied this logic to local scope functions could lead to the incorrect handling observed in the test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.flattenReferencesToCollapsibleDescendantNames(Name,String)",0.800000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions defined in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `flattenReferencesToCollapsibleDescendantNames` is designed to flatten references to collapsible properties of a global name, which suggests it primarily operates on global scope properties. In the failure context, the function `a` is defined in the global scope, but the property `a.b` is assigned within a local scope, which might not be handled correctly by this method if it assumes all properties are globally collapsible. This behavior supports Hypothesis H4, as a recent change in the codebase could have altered how local scope properties are treated, leading to the incorrect transformation observed in the test output. The method's focus on global names and its recursive handling of subnames might not account for the nuances of local scope property assignments, contributing to the failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.inlineAliases(GlobalNamespace),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `inlineAliases(GlobalNamespace)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering the behavior of property collapsing through its handling of qualified names in the global scope. The method ensures that no ancestor of a qualified name is aliased or assigned an unknown value type, which could affect how properties are collapsed. In the failure context, the test expects the property `a.b` to remain unchanged, but the result shows `a$b`, indicating that the method might have incorrectly collapsed the property due to changes in alias handling, thus supporting the hypothesis that recent codebase changes could have led to this behavior."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.process(Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.process(Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for the property collapsing process, which includes creating a `GlobalNamespace` and flattening references to collapsible descendant names. The failure context indicates that the function `a`'s property `b` was incorrectly collapsed into `a$b`, suggesting that the method's handling of property collapsing in local scopes might have been altered. If a recent change affected how `process` initializes or manipulates the `GlobalNamespace` or how it flattens references, it could lead to the observed incorrect behavior, supporting the hypothesis that a recent codebase change is the cause."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.updateFunctionDeclarationAtFunctionNode(Name),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of property collapsing, leading to incorrect handling of functions in local scopes.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CollapseProperties.updateFunctionDeclarationAtFunctionNode(Name)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially altering how properties are handled for functions in local scopes. Specifically, the method calls `addStubsForUndeclaredProperties`, which introduces stub variables for undeclared properties, as seen in the test output where `a.b` is transformed into `a$b`. This behavior indicates a change in property collapsing, which aligns with the hypothesis that a recent codebase modification could have affected the handling of functions and their properties in local scopes, leading to the observed test failure."
