"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parse(String,ParsePosition)",0.900000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or display of complex numbers without the imaginary unit character.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `ComplexFormat.parse(String, ParsePosition)` attempts to parse a string into a `Complex` object, starting by parsing and ignoring whitespace. The failure occurs when the method tries to access a substring beyond the string's length, as indicated by the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This suggests that the method expects a specific format, likely including an imaginary unit character, which is missing in the input ""1 + 1"". This supports Hypothesis H3, as the absence of the imaginary unit character in the input leads to improper parsing, causing the exception."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(String,NumberFormat,NumberFormat)",0.700000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or display of complex numbers without the imaginary unit character.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(String, NumberFormat, NumberFormat)` supports Hypothesis H3 as it directly involves setting the imaginary character through the `setImaginaryCharacter` method. If the imaginary character is incorrectly specified or missing, it could lead to improper parsing of complex numbers, as seen in the test failure where the string ""1 + 1"" lacks an explicit imaginary unit character. The failure context suggests that the absence of the imaginary character in the input string might not be handled correctly, causing the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parseNumber(String,NumberFormat,ParsePosition)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure may be caused by the test not correctly handling or expecting input strings that omit the imaginary unit character, leading to a parsing error or incorrect assumption about the input format.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parseNumber(String, NumberFormat, ParsePosition)` supports hypothesis H1 as it attempts to parse a number from the input string using the provided `NumberFormat`. If parsing fails, it recursively tries to parse special values like NaN or infinity. In the context of the test, the input ""1 + 1"" lacks an imaginary unit character, which could lead to a parsing error or incorrect assumptions about the input format, as the method does not explicitly handle cases where the imaginary unit is omitted, resulting in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This indicates that the method does not adequately address input strings missing the imaginary unit, supporting the hypothesis that the test fails due to this oversight."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or formatting of complex numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat()` constructs a `ComplexFormat` instance using default settings, including a default imaginary character and number format. This supports Hypothesis H2, as the failure could be due to the default imaginary character not being correctly specified or recognized, leading to improper parsing when the imaginary part is missing or incorrectly formatted. The test failure occurs when parsing ""1 + 1"", which lacks an explicit imaginary unit, suggesting that the default format might not handle such cases correctly."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(NumberFormat),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or formatting of complex numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(NumberFormat)` supports Hypothesis H2 by using the default imaginary character, which suggests that if the format specification for the imaginary part is incorrect or missing, it could lead to parsing issues. In the test case, the input ""1 + 1"" lacks an explicit imaginary unit (e.g., ""i""), which the method might expect due to its reliance on default settings. This reliance on defaults without explicit specification could result in the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed, as the method attempts to parse a non-existent imaginary part."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(String,NumberFormat)",0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or formatting of complex numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `ComplexFormat.ComplexFormat(String, NumberFormat)` supports hypothesis H2 by allowing the specification of a custom imaginary character and number format, which directly influences how complex numbers are parsed and formatted. If the imaginary character or number format is incorrectly specified or missing, it could lead to parsing errors, such as the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed. The method's reliance on a clone of the number format for the imaginary part suggests that any misconfiguration in this format could result in improper handling of the imaginary component, aligning with the hypothesis that the failure is due to format specification issues."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parseAndIgnoreWhitespace(String,ParsePosition)",0.300000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by an incorrect parsing logic in the `ComplexFormat` class that does not properly handle cases where the imaginary unit character is omitted or misplaced in the input string.,org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `parseAndIgnoreWhitespace` is designed to skip over whitespace characters in the input string and adjust the `ParsePosition` index accordingly. In the context of the failure, this method does not directly handle or validate the presence of the imaginary unit character, which supports Hypothesis H4. The failure occurs because the parsing logic in `ComplexFormat.parse` does not account for the absence or misplacement of the imaginary unit, leading to an `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when attempting to parse ""1 + 1"" without an imaginary component."
"org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.parseNextCharacter(String,ParsePosition)",0.300000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or display of complex numbers without the imaginary unit character.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `parseNextCharacter(String, ParsePosition)` is responsible for skipping whitespace and returning the first non-whitespace character from the input string. In the context of the failure, this method does not directly handle format specifications or the presence of the imaginary unit character. Instead, it simply advances the parsing position to the next relevant character. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3 directly, as it does not involve format validation or the presence of specific characters like the imaginary unit. The issue likely arises elsewhere in the parsing logic where the format specification is expected to handle the imaginary unit."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.getImaginaryCharacter(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or formatting of complex numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.getImaginaryCharacter()` supports Hypothesis H2 by indicating that the parsing failure could be due to an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part. Since this method returns the character used for formatting the imaginary component, if the character is not correctly set or expected, it could lead to parsing errors, such as the `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` observed when attempting to parse ""1 + 1"" without an explicit imaginary character. The absence or misconfiguration of this character could cause the parser to misinterpret the input, resulting in the error."
org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.setImaginaryCharacter(String),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect or missing format specification for the imaginary part in the `ComplexFormat` class, leading to improper parsing or formatting of complex numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexFormat.setImaginaryCharacter(String)` supports hypothesis H2 by ensuring that a valid imaginary character is specified for formatting complex numbers. If the imaginary character is not set correctly or is missing, it could lead to improper parsing, as seen in the test failure where the string ""1 + 1"" lacks an imaginary part. The method's requirement for a non-null and non-empty input suggests that an incorrect or missing format specification could indeed cause parsing issues, aligning with the hypothesis."
