org.mockito.internal.progress.HandyReturnValues.returnFor(Class),0.910000,H1,0.500000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test.",org.mockito.internal.progress.HandyReturnValues (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.progress.HandyReturnValues.returnFor(Class)` supports hypothesis H1 as it suggests that the method is responsible for returning default values for primitive types and their wrappers. The failure occurs because the method likely returns an `Integer` instead of a `Double` for the `double.class`, leading to a `ClassCastException`. This indicates a potential recent change or bug in how the method determines and returns default values for primitive types, aligning with the hypothesis that a change in the framework's handling of default values might have caused the test failure."
org.mockito.internal.util.Primitives.primitiveValueOrNullFor(Class),0.908632,H3,0.500000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected test outcomes.",org.mockito.internal.util.Primitives (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.util.Primitives.primitiveValueOrNullFor(Class)` retrieves default primitive values from a static map `primitiveValues`. The ClassCastException in the test indicates that an `Integer` was returned instead of a `Double`, suggesting that the map might have been incorrectly updated or initialized, leading to a mismatch with expected test outcomes. This supports Hypothesis H3, as a recent change in the map's initialization or contents could have altered the default return values, causing the failure."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues.returnValueFor(Class),0.906842,H1,0.500000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues (HH1),"The method `returnValueFor(Class<?> type)` supports hypothesis H1 as it determines the default return value for a given class type, including primitives, by calling `Primitives.primitiveValueOrNullFor(type)`. If there was a recent change in how `Primitives.primitiveValueOrNullFor(type)` handles primitive types, it could lead to a mismatch between the expected and actual return values, such as returning an `Integer` instead of a `Double` for `double.class`. This would directly cause the `ClassCastException` observed in the test failure, aligning with the hypothesis that a change in default return values might be responsible."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues.answer(InvocationOnMock),0.800000,H1,0.500000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsEmptyValues (HH1),"The method `ReturnsEmptyValues.answer(InvocationOnMock)` is responsible for providing default return values for primitive types when a method is invoked on a mock object. If this method was recently changed to return an `Integer` instead of a `Double` for methods returning `double`, it would support hypothesis H1, as this change would cause a `ClassCastException` when the test expects a `Double`. The stack trace indicates that the failure occurs when attempting to cast an `Integer` to a `Double`, suggesting that the method might indeed be returning an incorrect default value, aligning with the hypothesis of a recent change causing the mismatch."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMoreEmptyValues.answer(InvocationOnMock),0.800000,H1,0.500000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMoreEmptyValues (HH1),"The method `ReturnsMoreEmptyValues.answer(InvocationOnMock)` delegates the call to another answer method and checks if the returned object is non-null. If it is non-null, it returns that object; otherwise, it proceeds to handle the return value based on the class type. The failure in the test suggests that the method might be returning an `Integer` instead of a `Double` for `double.class`, which aligns with hypothesis H1. This indicates a potential change in how default values are handled, as the method should ensure the correct primitive type is returned, but instead, it seems to be returning an incorrect type, leading to the `ClassCastException`."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks.answer(InvocationOnMock),0.800000,H1,0.500000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the default return values for primitive types in the Mockito framework, leading to a mismatch with the expected values in the test.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsMocks.answer(InvocationOnMock)` supports hypothesis H1 by indicating that the failure could be due to a change in how default return values are handled. The method first delegates the invocation to another answer implementation, and if a non-null value is returned, it uses that value. If the delegate returns an `Integer` instead of a `Double` for a `double` primitive type, this would lead to a `ClassCastException`, as seen in the stack trace. This suggests that a recent change might have altered the default return behavior, causing the mismatch with the expected `double` value in the test."
