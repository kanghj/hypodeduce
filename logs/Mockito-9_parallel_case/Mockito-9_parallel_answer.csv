org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods.answer(InvocationOnMock),0.100000,H1,0.000000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a mismatch between the expected and actual constructor parameters when creating a mock object, leading to incorrect initialization.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.answers.CallsRealMethods.answer(InvocationOnMock)` does not support hypothesis H1. The failure is not related to constructor parameters or initialization issues, as this method simply attempts to delegate the call to the real method implementation using `invocation.callRealMethod()`. The error occurs because `invocation.callRealMethod()` cannot be used on abstract methods, which is unrelated to constructor parameter mismatches. The stack trace and error message indicate that the issue arises from attempting to call a real method on an abstract method, not from constructor parameter mismatches."
