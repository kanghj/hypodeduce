"org.apache.commons.math.fraction.ProperFractionFormat.parse(String,ParsePosition)",0.810000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testParseProperInvalidMinus"" may be failing due to the FractionFormat class incorrectly handling or parsing input strings with misplaced or multiple minus signs, leading to unexpected exceptions or incorrect fraction values.",org.apache.commons.math.fraction.ProperFractionFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.ProperFractionFormat.parse(String, ParsePosition)` is designed to parse strings formatted as proper fractions, where minus signs are only allowed in the whole number part. The test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` fails because the method does not throw a `ParseException` for input strings like ""2 -2 / 3"" and ""2 2 / -3"", which contain minus signs in the fractional part. This behavior supports Hypothesis H1, as the method incorrectly handles these inputs by not recognizing them as invalid, leading to the test failure."

The test `testParseProperInvalidMinus` fails because the method does not throw a `ParseException` when encountering misplaced minus signs, such as ""2 -2 / 3"" or ""2 2 / -3"". This suggests that the method may not correctly handle or validate the position of minus signs in the input string, thus supporting Hypothesis H1. The method's failure to identify these as invalid inputs and raise exceptions indicates a potential flaw in its parsing logic regarding negative signs."
org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionFormat.parse(String),0.806842,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The test ""testParseProperInvalidMinus"" may be failing due to the FractionFormat class incorrectly handling or parsing input strings with misplaced or multiple minus signs, leading to unexpected exceptions or incorrect fraction values.",org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionFormat (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.fraction.FractionFormat.parse(String)` is designed to parse a string into a `Fraction` object and throws a `ParseException` if the string cannot be parsed correctly. In the test `testParseProperInvalidMinus`, the input strings ""2 -2 / 3"" and ""2 2 / -3"" contain misplaced minus signs, which should trigger a `ParseException`. However, the test fails, indicating that the method may not be correctly identifying or handling these invalid minus signs, thus supporting Hypothesis H1. The method's failure to throw the expected exception suggests it might not be adequately checking for or processing improper placement of minus signs in the input string."

The test failure in `testParseProperInvalidMinus` suggests an issue with how `FractionFormat` parses strings with misplaced or multiple minus signs, which occurs before the `Fraction` constructor is invoked. The constructor itself does not handle parsing logic or string input, so it does not directly address the parsing errors hypothesized in H1."

Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it is unrelated to the parsing logic of the `FractionFormat` class. The failure in `testParseProperInvalidMinus` is likely due to issues within the parsing logic of `FractionFormat`, which is responsible for interpreting the input strings, rather than the GCD computation."

This method does not directly handle string parsing or validation of minus signs in fractions. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as the hypothesis concerns the parsing logic of the `FractionFormat` class, not the determination of integer signs. The failure in the test likely arises from the parsing logic itself, which is not influenced by the `sign` method."
