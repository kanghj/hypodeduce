"org.joda.time.Partial.with(DateTimeFieldType,int)",0.900000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual range of values for the base and argument fields in the `Partial` object, leading to an invalid operation or comparison.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.with(DateTimeFieldType, int)` does not directly support Hypothesis H1, as the failure is not due to a mismatch in the expected and actual range of values for the fields. Instead, the error occurs because the method attempts to add a new field (`DateTimeFieldType.era()`) to a `Partial` object that already contains a field (`DateTimeFieldType.year()`) without allowing duplicates. The stack trace indicates that the `Partial` constructor throws an `IllegalArgumentException` due to the presence of duplicate field types, which contradicts the hypothesis that the issue is related to value ranges."
"org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType,int)",0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect assumption about the compatibility of the base and argument types, leading to an invalid operation or state within the `TestPartial_Basics::testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` method.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType, int)` supports Hypothesis H2 by demonstrating that the failure is due to an incorrect assumption about the compatibility of the base and argument types. The method constructs a `Partial` object with a single field and value, and when `test.with(DateTimeFieldType.era(), 1)` is called, it attempts to add a new field to the existing `Partial`. However, the constructor enforces a rule that the types array must not contain duplicates, and since `era` and `year` are considered incompatible or duplicate in this context, it results in an `IllegalArgumentException`. This indicates that the assumption about the compatibility of `era` and `year` fields is incorrect, leading to the failure."
"org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType[],int[],Chronology)",0.800000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual range of values for the base and argument fields in the `Partial` object, leading to an invalid operation or comparison.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType[], int[], Chronology)` constructs a `Partial` object with specified fields and values, requiring the fields to be ordered from largest to smallest. The failure in the test occurs because the `Partial` constructor checks for duplicate field types, as indicated by the error message ""Types array must not contain duplicate: era and year."" This suggests that the failure is not due to a mismatch in the range of values but rather due to the presence of duplicate field types, contradicting Hypothesis H1. The call flow shows that the error arises when attempting to add a duplicate field type (`era`) to an existing `Partial` object that already contains the `year` field."
"org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType,int,Chronology)",0.700000,H1,0.800000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual range of values for the base and argument fields in the `Partial` object, leading to an invalid operation or comparison.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.Partial(DateTimeFieldType,int,Chronology)` does not directly support Hypothesis H1, as it focuses on constructing a `Partial` object with a single field and value, ensuring the field type and value are valid within the specified chronology. The failure in the test is due to the presence of duplicate field types (""era"" and ""year"") in the `Partial` object, as indicated by the error message. This suggests that the issue is not related to a mismatch in the range of values but rather to the duplication of field types, which the constructor does not allow."

The failure in the test is due to duplicate field types (""era"" and ""year"") rather than a mismatch in value ranges. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H4, as it does not involve range validation or operations that could lead to the exception observed."
org.joda.time.Partial.getFieldType(int),0.200000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by a mismatch in the expected and actual range of values for the partial fields, leading to an invalid operation or exception.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.getFieldType(int)` simply retrieves the `DateTimeFieldType` at a specified index from the `iTypes` array without performing any range validation or checks. This method does not support Hypothesis H4, as it neither validates the range of values nor contributes to the exception caused by duplicate field types. The failure is due to the presence of duplicate field types ('era' and 'year') in the `Partial` object, not a mismatch in expected and actual ranges."
org.joda.time.Partial.getChronology(),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect assumption about the compatibility of the base and argument types, leading to an invalid operation or state within the `TestPartial_Basics::testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` method.",org.joda.time.Partial (HH1),"The method `org.joda.time.Partial.getChronology()` returns the chronology associated with the `Partial` instance, which is not directly related to the compatibility of the base and argument types in the `with` method. The failure in `TestPartial_Basics::testWith_baseAndArgHaveNoRange` is due to the presence of duplicate types (era and year) in the `Partial` instance, as indicated by the error message. Since `getChronology()` does not interact with or validate the types within the `Partial`, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2 regarding type compatibility assumptions."

It does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any operations related to the range of values for the fields. Instead, the failure is due to the presence of duplicate field types (era and year) in the `Partial` object, as indicated by the error message, which is unrelated to the range of values. The method simply counts the fields and does not perform any validation or comparison of field ranges."
