"org.apache.commons.math3.util.ContinuedFraction.evaluate(double,double,int)",0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistributionTest::testMath718"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the binomial distribution calculation, such as when the probability parameter is set to 0 or 1.",org.apache.commons.math3.util.ContinuedFraction (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.util.ContinuedFraction.evaluate(double, double, int)` is responsible for evaluating continued fractions using the modified Lentz algorithm. The failure in `testMath718` is due to a `ConvergenceException` when the continued fraction diverges to NaN, which suggests that the algorithm struggles with convergence for certain inputs. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the failure could be related to edge cases in the binomial distribution calculation, particularly when the probability parameter approaches 0 or 1, leading to numerical instability in the continued fraction evaluation. The method's reliance on convergence criteria and handling of small values (e.g., `small = 1e-50`) indicates potential sensitivity to such edge cases."
"org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.regularizedBeta(double,double,double,double,int)",0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistributionTest::testMath718"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the binomial distribution calculation, such as when the probability parameter is set to 0 or 1.",org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.regularizedBeta(double, double, double, double, int)` calculates the regularized beta function, which is crucial for computing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution. In the failure context, the method is invoked with `x = 0.5`, `a = trials - p + 1`, and `b = p + 1` during the calculation of the inverse cumulative probability. The hypothesis H1 suggests that the failure might be due to edge cases with probability parameters 0 or 1, but the error occurs with `x = 0.5`, indicating that the issue is more likely related to numerical instability in the continued fraction evaluation for large `trials`, rather than incorrect handling of edge cases with extreme probability values."
"org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.regularizedBeta(double,double,double)",0.806842,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistributionTest::testMath718"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the binomial distribution calculation, such as when the probability parameter is set to 0 or 1.",org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.regularizedBeta(double, double, double)` is used to compute the regularized incomplete beta function, which is integral to calculating probabilities in binomial distributions. In the failure context, the method is invoked with parameters derived from the binomial distribution's probability calculations, specifically with `x = 0.5`, `a = trials / 2`, and `b = trials / 2`. The failure occurs due to a `ConvergenceException`, indicating that the continued fraction used in the computation diverged to NaN. This suggests that the method may not handle large parameter values well, but it does not directly support hypothesis H1, as the failure is not explicitly linked to edge cases where the probability parameter is 0 or 1. Instead, it points to potential numerical instability in handling large trials, which is unrelated to the edge cases described in H1."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution.cumulativeProbability(int),0.804526,H4,0.800000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistributionTest::testMath718"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases where the number of trials or probability parameters are set to extreme values, such as zero or one.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistribution (HH1),"The method `cumulativeProbability(int x)` in `BinomialDistribution` handles edge cases by returning 0.0 when `x` is less than 0 and 1.0 when `x` is greater than or equal to the number of trials. This suggests that the method is designed to handle extreme values for `x` gracefully. However, the failure in `testMath718` is related to the `inverseCumulativeProbability` method, which relies on the `regularizedBeta` function. The `ConvergenceException` indicates that the issue arises from the continued fraction evaluation diverging, which is not directly addressed by the edge case handling in `cumulativeProbability`. Therefore, while `cumulativeProbability` handles certain edge cases, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H4 regarding the failure due to extreme values in the context of `inverseCumulativeProbability`."

Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any logic for handling probability parameters like 0 or 1. The failure in `testMath718` is more likely related to the evaluation logic within the `ContinuedFraction.evaluate` method, which is responsible for the convergence issues, rather than the constructor itself."
"org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.logBeta(double,double,double,int)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.BinomialDistributionTest::testMath718"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the binomial distribution calculation, such as when the probability parameter is set to 0 or 1.",org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.special.Beta.logBeta(double, double, double, int)` calculates the natural logarithm of the beta function, which is a component in the computation of the regularized beta function used in binomial distribution calculations. The failure in `testMath718` involves a `ConvergenceException` during the evaluation of a continued fraction, which is part of the regularized beta function computation. However, the `logBeta` method itself does not directly handle edge cases where the probability parameter is 0 or 1, as it primarily focuses on computing the logarithm of the beta function for given parameters. Therefore, while `logBeta` is involved in the broader calculation, it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1 regarding edge case handling in binomial distribution calculations."

The method handles edge cases by returning 0 for non-positive `x`, which is a standard approach for cumulative distribution functions. This behavior does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as the failure in `testMath718` is related to the convergence of a continued fraction in the binomial distribution's inverse cumulative probability calculation, not the handling of edge cases like probability parameters set to 0 or 1."

The FDistribution constructor deals with creating an F distribution based on degrees of freedom and accuracy parameters, which are not directly involved in the binomial distribution's probability parameter handling. The failure in `testMath718` is related to the convergence of a continued fraction in the binomial distribution's inverse cumulative probability calculation, not the construction of an F distribution. Thus, this method neither supports nor contradicts H1."

The FDistribution constructor deals with creating an F distribution based on degrees of freedom and throws an exception if these are not strictly positive. This does not involve handling edge cases for probability parameters in a binomial distribution, such as 0 or 1, which is the focus of H1. The failure in `testMath718` is related to the convergence of a continued fraction in the binomial distribution's cumulative probability calculation, not the construction of an F distribution."

Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not address the specific edge cases mentioned in the hypothesis."
