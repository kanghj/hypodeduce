# GPT-only Results for Math-41

## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[],double[],double,int,int)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "testEvaluateArraySegmentWeighted" might be caused by incorrect handling or calculation of weights in the variance computation, leading to inaccurate results for specific array segments. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Variance.evaluate(double[], double[], double, int, int)` calculates the weighted variance for a specified segment of an array using a precomputed weighted mean. The failure in `testEvaluateArraySegmentWeighted` suggests a dis...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[],double[],int,int)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "testEvaluateArraySegmentWeighted" might be caused by incorrect handling or calculation of weights in the variance computation, leading to inaccurate results for specific array segments. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Variance.evaluate(double[], double[], int, int)` computes the weighted variance using the formula \(\Sigma(\text{weights}[i] \times (\text{values}[i] - \text{weightedMean})^2)/(\Sigma(\text{weights}[i]) - 1)\). The failure in...

3. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.evaluate(double[],double[])** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "testEvaluateArraySegmentWeighted" might be caused by incorrect handling or calculation of weights in the variance computation, leading to inaccurate results for specific array segments. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Variance.evaluate(double[], double[])` supports hypothesis H1 as it computes the weighted variance by invoking `evaluate(double[], double[], int, int)` over the entire array range, which suggests that any miscalculation in ha...

4. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.Variance()** — score 0.300. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "testEvaluateArraySegmentWeighted" might be caused by incorrect handling or calculation of weights in the variance computation, leading to inaccurate results for specific array segments. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Variance.Variance()` initializes a `Variance` instance with a default bias correction setting and a new `SecondMoment` object, but it does not explicitly handle weights. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure in `testEva...

5. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance.clear()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases where the weights array contains zero or negative values, leading to unexpected behavior in the variance calculation. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.moment.Variance (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `Variance.clear()` does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H3, as it primarily resets the internal state by calling `moment.clear()` when incremental moment calculation is enabled. This method does not interact with...
