(confidence 0.500); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.assemble(Fields)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for setting up the cutover logic between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The failure in the test `test_cutoverPreZero` sugges...

3. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getDateTimeMillis(int,int,int,int)** — score 0.807. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.500); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getDateTimeMillis(int, int, int, int)` supports Hypothesis H1 because it handles date conversions around the Julian to Gregorian cutover. The method defaults to using the Gregorian chronology...

4. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.convertByWeekyear(long,Chronology,Chronology)** — score 0.805. best hypothesis H4: Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Gregorian-Julian calendar cutover logic for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.400); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `convertByWeekyear` in `GJChronology` is responsible for converting a datetime from one chronology to another by setting the weekyear in the target chronology based on the weekyear from the source chronology. In the context of...

5. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.convertByYear(long,Chronology,Chronology)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover logic for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.convertByYear(long, Chronology, Chronology)` supports Hypothesis H3 as it is responsible for converting dates between different chronologies, which includes handling the Julian to Gregorian c...

6. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getGregorianCutover()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H2: Hypothesis H2: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Gregorian-Julian calendar cutover logic for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date transitions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getGregorianCutover()` returns the cutover instant, which is crucial for determining the transition point between the Julian and Gregorian calendars. In the failure context, the test `test_cu...

7. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getInstance(DateTimeZone,ReadableInstant,int)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.500); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `GJChronology.getInstance(DateTimeZone, ReadableInstant, int)` supports hypothesis H1 because it allows specifying a custom cutover date, which is crucial for handling the transition from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. ...

8. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.500); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.getInstanceUTC()` supports Hypothesis H1 as it involves handling the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover, which is crucial for dates around year zero. The test failure occurs when attempting...

9. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.gregorianToJulianByWeekyear(long)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H3: Hypothesis H3: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover logic for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `gregorianToJulianByWeekyear(long)` supports Hypothesis H3 as it directly involves converting dates between the Gregorian and Julian calendars, which is central to handling the cutover logic. The failure in `test_cutoverPreZer...

10. **org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology.gregorianToJulianByYear(long)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of the Julian to Gregorian calendar cutover for dates before year zero, leading to miscalculated date conversions. (confidence 0.500); supporting class org.joda.time.chrono.GJChronology (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `gregorianToJulianByYear(long)` supports hypothesis H1 as it directly deals with converting dates between the Gregorian and Julian calendars. The failure in the test `test_cutoverPreZero` suggests an issue with handling dates ...
