## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Object)** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testAddNonComparable" may be caused by the method attempting to add elements that do not implement the Comparable interface, leading to a ClassCastException during sorting or comparison operations. (confidence 0.900); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.addValue(Object)` supports hypothesis H1 by requiring that any object added must be comparable to previously added objects, as indicated by the method's summary and the `IllegalArgumentE...

2. **org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.Frequency()** — score 0.200. best hypothesis H1: H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math.stat.FrequencyTest::testAddNonComparable" may be caused by the method attempting to add elements that do not implement the Comparable interface, leading to a ClassCastException during sorting or comparison operations. (confidence 0.900); supporting class org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency (HH1).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math.stat.Frequency.Frequency()` initializes the internal frequency table using a `TreeMap`, which inherently requires elements to be `Comparable` for sorting purposes. This supports hypothesis H1, as attem...
