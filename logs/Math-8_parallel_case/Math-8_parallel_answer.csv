The failure in `testIssue942` is due to an `ArrayStoreException`, which suggests that the array type used to store the sample is incompatible with the elements being inserted. This indicates a type mismatch rather than an issue with probability distribution calculations, contradicting Hypothesis H1. The error occurs because the method attempts to store objects of an anonymous class in an array that expects a different type, not due to incorrect handling of edge cases in probability calculations."

If the probabilities provided in the list are not correctly validated or normalized, it could lead to unexpected results, such as the `ArrayStoreException` seen in the test failure. The error suggests a potential issue with how the distribution handles the input list of pairs, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about the types or values of the probabilities."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.sample(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4),"The failure in `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942` is likely not due to incorrect handling of edge cases in probability distribution calculations, as suggested by Hypothesis H1. The `DiscreteDistribution.sample()` method generates a random value by iterating through the probability array and returning the corresponding singleton, which suggests that the logic for handling probabilities is sound. The `ArrayStoreException` indicates a type mismatch issue, likely due to the `Pair<Object, Double>` being used incorrectly or incompatibly with the expected array type, rather than a problem with probability calculations."
org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(List),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(List)` initializes a discrete distribution using the provided list of pairs, where each pair consists of an object and its associated probability. The failure in `testIssue942` is due to an `ArrayStoreException`, which suggests that the issue arises from the handling of the list elements during sampling, rather than from edge cases in probability calculations. The method's reliance on the constructor `DiscreteDistribution(RandomGenerator, List)` indicates that the problem likely lies in how the list elements are processed or stored, contradicting Hypothesis H1, which focuses on probability calculation errors."
