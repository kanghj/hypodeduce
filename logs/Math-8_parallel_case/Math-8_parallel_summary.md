## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.sample(int)** — score 0.900. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.sample(int)` generates a random sample from the distribution and returns it as an array. The failure in `testIssue942` is due to an `ArrayStoreException`, which sugge...

2. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(RandomGenerator,List)** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(RandomGenerator, List)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it involves validating and normalizing probabilities, which are critical steps in handling edge...

3. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.sample()** — score 0.800. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4).
    Explanation: The failure in `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942` is likely not due to incorrect handling of edge cases in probability distribution calculations, as suggested by Hypothesis H1. The `Discret...

4. **org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(List)** — score 0.700. best hypothesis H1: Hypothesis H1: The failure in "org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteRealDistributionTest::testIssue942" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the probability distribution calculations, leading to unexpected results. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.DiscreteDistribution.DiscreteDistribution(List)` initializes a discrete distribution using the provided list of pairs, where each pair consists of an object and its associated probability...
