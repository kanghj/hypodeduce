"com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldArrayAccess(Node,Node,Node)",0.900000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass that mishandles array element access, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `tryFoldArrayAccess` attempts to optimize array access expressions by replacing them with the actual array element value when possible. It checks if the array access is an assignment target using `isAssignmentTarget`, which determines if folding is permissible. In the failure context, the test case `fold(""x = [,10][0]"", ""x = void 0"")` results in an unexpected error because the method likely mishandles the access to an array with an undefined element at index 0, leading to an incorrect optimization. This supports Hypothesis H4, as the method's optimization logic appears to incorrectly handle cases where the array contains undefined elements, resulting in unexpected behavior."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldGetElem(Node,Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `tryFoldGetElem(Node n, Node left, Node right)` supports Hypothesis H1 as it attempts to optimize array element access by folding constants, which can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly. In the failure context, the test case `fold(""x = [,10][0]"", ""x = void 0"")` suggests that the method might incorrectly optimize the access to an empty array slot, resulting in an unexpected ""index out of bounds"" error. The method's logic, particularly when handling object literals or array accesses, could be misapplying constant folding, causing the observed failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.optimizeSubtree(Node),0.800000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass that mishandles array element access, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.optimizeSubtree(Node)` supports hypothesis H2 as it involves optimization processes that could potentially mishandle array element access. Specifically, the method dispatches optimization based on node types and includes calls to functions like `tryFoldCtorCall` and `tryFoldBinaryOperator`, which might incorrectly optimize array access expressions. The failure context indicates an unexpected error related to array index handling, suggesting that the optimization logic in `optimizeSubtree` might not correctly handle cases where the array index is non-integer or out of bounds, leading to the observed failure."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldBinaryOperator(Node),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldBinaryOperator(Node)` supports hypothesis H1. It attempts to optimize binary operations, including array element access, by calling methods like `tryFoldGetElem`. In the failure context, the test case `fold(""x = [,10][0]"", ""x = void 0"")` results in an unexpected ""index out of bounds"" error, suggesting that `tryFoldGetElem` might be incorrectly optimizing the access to an empty array slot, leading to the failure. This aligns with the hypothesis that the optimization pass is improperly applied, causing unexpected results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryReduceOperandsForOp(Node),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryReduceOperandsForOp(Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it attempts to reduce operands by converting them to numbers, which could lead to incorrect optimizations if applied improperly to array element access. In the failure context, the test case `fold(""x = [,10][0]"", ""x = void 0"")` results in an unexpected error due to an out-of-bounds index, suggesting that the method might have incorrectly converted or interpreted the index `0` as `0.0`, causing the optimization to fail. This aligns with the hypothesis that constant folding is improperly applied, leading to unexpected results."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.PeepholeFoldConstants(boolean),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.PeepholeFoldConstants(boolean)` supports hypothesis H1 as it sets the optimization mode (`late`), which could allow aggressive optimizations. This setting might lead to improper constant folding during array element access, as seen in the failure context where an unexpected `INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERROR` occurs. The constructor's role in enabling aggressive optimizations aligns with the hypothesis that such optimizations could cause incorrect behavior in the `testFoldGetElem` test."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldAssign(Node,Node,Node)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.tryFoldAssign(Node,Node,Node)` focuses on folding assignment expressions into compound assignments, which is unrelated to array element access optimizations. Since it does not handle or optimize array indexing directly, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1. The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" likely stems from a different part of the code that specifically deals with array element access, rather than the assignment folding handled by this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.isAssignmentTarget(Node),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" might be caused by an incorrect optimization in the PeepholeFoldConstants pass, where constant folding is improperly applied to array element access, leading to unexpected results.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.PeepholeFoldConstants.isAssignmentTarget(Node)` checks if a node is the target of an assignment or increment/decrement operation, which is unrelated to constant folding of array element access. Since it does not involve evaluating or optimizing array indices, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly. The failure in ""testFoldGetElem"" is likely due to incorrect handling of array indices during constant folding, which this method does not address."
