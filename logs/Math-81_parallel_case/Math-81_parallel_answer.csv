"org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl.computeShiftIncrement(int,int,int)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl (HH3),"The method `computeShiftIncrement` is responsible for estimating the smallest eigenvalue by translating the LAPACK routine DLAZQ4. The failure in `testMath308` with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests that the method may not correctly handle edge cases, such as when the indices `start`, `end`, or `deflated` lead to invalid array accesses. This supports hypothesis H1, as the method's logic might not adequately account for edge cases like repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices, potentially causing incorrect index calculations and subsequent exceptions."
"org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl.goodStep(int,int)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl (HH3),"The method `goodStep(int start, int end)` in `EigenDecompositionImpl` is involved in processing eigenvalues, and its failure with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` suggests a potential issue with handling edge cases. The exception occurs when accessing array indices, which supports hypothesis H1, as it indicates that the method may not correctly handle matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices, leading to incorrect index calculations. The method's logic, particularly in managing indices during eigenvalue deflation or shifts, could be flawed, causing it to access invalid array positions."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl.processGeneralBlock(int),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImpl (HH3),"The method `processGeneralBlock(int n)` in `EigenDecompositionImpl` is responsible for computing real eigenvalues using the dqd/dqds algorithms, which are sensitive to the structure of the matrix, including edge cases like repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices. The failure context indicates an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, suggesting that the method may not correctly handle edge cases where the matrix dimensions or indices are not properly managed, potentially supporting hypothesis H1. Specifically, the loop iterating over matrix elements (`for (int i = 0; i < n - 1;`) might not account for edge cases, leading to incorrect index calculations and subsequent exceptions."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealMatrix.transpose(),0.200000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the matrix input, such as singular matrices or matrices with very small eigenvalues, leading to numerical instability.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealMatrix (HH3),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealMatrix.transpose()` is responsible for transposing a matrix by swapping its rows and columns. This operation itself does not directly handle or affect the computation of eigenvalues or the stability of the matrix decomposition process. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3, as the hypothesis pertains to the handling of edge cases in eigenvalue computation, which is not directly related to the transposition operation. The failure in `testMath308` is more likely related to the logic in `EigenDecompositionImpl` rather than the transposition of matrices."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][]),0.200000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the matrix input, such as singular matrices or matrices with very small eigenvalues, leading to numerical instability.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixUtils (HH1),"The method `MatrixUtils.createRealMatrix(double[][])` simply creates a `RealMatrix` instance from a given 2D array without performing any checks or operations that could directly handle edge cases like singular matrices or matrices with very small eigenvalues. Since it does not involve any logic for numerical stability or edge case handling, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H3 directly. The failure in `testMath308` is more likely related to subsequent operations on the matrix, such as eigenvalue computations, rather than the matrix creation itself."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealMatrix.walkInOptimizedOrder(RealMatrixPreservingVisitor),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealMatrix (HH3),"The method `walkInOptimizedOrder` in `AbstractRealMatrix` simply delegates to `walkInRowOrder`, which implies it does not directly handle or optimize for edge cases in eigenvalue computations, such as repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices. This method is primarily concerned with traversing matrix elements in a specific order and does not engage in the eigenvalue computation process itself. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with the eigenvalue computation logic where the failure occurs."
"org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixUtils.checkMultiplicationCompatible(AnyMatrix,AnyMatrix)",0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.MatrixUtils.checkMultiplicationCompatible(AnyMatrix, AnyMatrix)` is unrelated to hypothesis H1 because it focuses solely on verifying the compatibility of matrix dimensions for multiplication, ensuring that the number of columns in the left matrix matches the number of rows in the right matrix. It does not involve any logic related to eigenvalue computation, edge cases, or handling of matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis regarding the failure in eigenvalue computation."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector.ArrayRealVector(double[]),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.EigenDecompositionImplTest::testMath308"" could be due to incorrect handling of edge cases in the eigenvalue computation algorithm, such as matrices with repeated eigenvalues or near-singular matrices.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector.ArrayRealVector(double[])` simply constructs a vector by copying the input array, which does not directly relate to the hypothesis H1 concerning the handling of edge cases in eigenvalue computation. The failure in `testMath308` is due to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, which suggests an issue in accessing array elements, possibly in the eigenvalue computation logic itself, rather than in the vector construction. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts H1, as it does not involve any logic related to eigenvalue computation or handling of edge cases."
