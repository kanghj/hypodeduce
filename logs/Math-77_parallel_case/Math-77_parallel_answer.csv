org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector.getLInfNorm(),0.900000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVector.getLInfNorm()` calculates the infinity norm (maximum absolute value) of a vector. The implementation incorrectly accumulates the maximum value in the loop, which should instead find the maximum absolute value of the elements. This flaw in the method could lead to incorrect results for the infinity norm, supporting Hypothesis H1 by demonstrating a potential error in vector arithmetic operations. Specifically, the expected behavior is to return the largest absolute value of the vector elements, but the current implementation accumulates values, which could lead to unexpected results like the failure observed in the test."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealVector.getL1Norm(),0.800000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to a recent change in the underlying data structure of ArrayRealVector that introduced an inconsistency in how vector operations are performed.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealVector (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.AbstractRealVector.getL1Norm()` calculates the L1 norm by iterating over the vector's entries and summing their absolute values. The failure in the test, where an unexpected value of 128.0 was returned instead of the expected 6.0, suggests a potential inconsistency in how vector operations are performed, possibly due to a recent change in the data structure. If the underlying data structure of `ArrayRealVector` was altered, it might affect the iteration or the values accessed during the computation, supporting Hypothesis H3."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getLInfNorm(),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getLInfNorm()` computes the L-infinity norm by iterating over all entries and accumulating their absolute values, which should yield the maximum absolute value of the vector's entries. The failure in the test case, where an expected value of 6.0 was compared against an actual value of 128.0, suggests that the method might be incorrectly summing values instead of finding the maximum, which contradicts Hypothesis H1. This indicates a potential issue with the implementation of the L-infinity norm calculation rather than vector arithmetic operations like addition or scalar multiplication."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[]),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases, such as zero-length vectors, leading to unexpected behavior in the test.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[])` supports Hypothesis H4 by potentially mishandling edge cases, such as zero-length vectors. Since it constructs the vector by storing only non-zero entries, a zero-length vector would result in an empty internal representation. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the test expects operations on a zero-length vector to yield specific results, such as a norm of zero, but instead encounters issues due to the absence of any entries. The failure in the test, where an unexpected value of 128.0 is encountered instead of the expected 6.0, suggests that the handling of such edge cases might be flawed, possibly due to incorrect assumptions about the vector's internal state when it is empty or nearly empty."
"org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[],double)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(double[], double)` constructs a vector by storing only non-default values based on a specified zero tolerance (epsilon). This approach could support Hypothesis H1 if the incorrect handling of default values or epsilon leads to unexpected results in vector arithmetic operations. For instance, if the method incorrectly identifies non-zero values as default due to an inappropriate epsilon, it might result in incorrect vector operations like addition or scalar multiplication, potentially causing the observed test failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.util.OpenIntToDoubleHashMap.put(int,double)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math.util.OpenIntToDoubleHashMap (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.OpenIntToDoubleHashMap.put(int, double)` is primarily responsible for storing key-value pairs in a map, which does not directly involve vector arithmetic operations like addition or scalar multiplication. The failure in `org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions` suggests a discrepancy in expected versus actual results of vector operations, such as norms or other calculations. Since the `put` method deals with data storage rather than arithmetic, it is unlikely to support hypothesis H1, as it does not directly affect the computation of vector norms or arithmetic operations."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.isDefaultValue(double),0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by incorrect handling of edge cases, such as zero-length vectors or vectors with NaN/Infinity values, leading to unexpected behavior in basic vector operations.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.isDefaultValue(double)` checks if a given value is approximately zero, which is crucial for handling edge cases like zero-length vectors or vectors with NaN/Infinity values. If this method incorrectly identifies non-zero values as zero (or vice versa), it could lead to unexpected behavior in vector operations, such as incorrect norm calculations. However, since the method only checks proximity to zero and does not interact with other methods, it is unlikely to directly cause the failure unless the epsilon threshold is improperly set, affecting edge case handling."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.sparseIterator(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.sparseIterator()` provides an iterator for non-default entries of a sparse vector, which is unrelated to the arithmetic operations like addition or scalar multiplication directly. Since it does not perform or influence arithmetic operations, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1. The failure in the test is more likely due to issues within the arithmetic methods themselves rather than the iteration over vector entries."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector$OpenMapSparseIterator.hasNext(),0.200000,H3,0.700000,"Hypothesis H3: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to a recent change in the underlying data structure of ArrayRealVector that introduced an inconsistency in how vector operations are performed.",,"The method `OpenMapRealVector$OpenMapSparseIterator.hasNext()` is unrelated to the hypothesis H3, as it only checks for the presence of more elements in the sparse iterator and does not interact with or modify the underlying data structure of `ArrayRealVector`. The failure in `testBasicFunctions` is likely due to an inconsistency in vector operations, but this method does not perform any vector operations or affect their outcomes. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis regarding changes in the data structure affecting vector operations."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector$OpenMapSparseIterator.next(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.linear.ArrayRealVectorTest::testBasicFunctions"" could be due to an incorrect implementation of vector arithmetic operations, such as addition or scalar multiplication, leading to unexpected results.",,"The method `OpenMapRealVector$OpenMapSparseIterator.next()` is unrelated to vector arithmetic operations like addition or scalar multiplication, as it solely advances the iterator and returns the current entry without performing any arithmetic operations. Since it does not interact with or modify vector values, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, which suggests that the failure is due to incorrect arithmetic operations. The failure in the test is more likely related to the arithmetic logic within methods that directly perform operations on vector elements."
