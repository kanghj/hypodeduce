org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.withOuterClass(Class),0.910000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing because the `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes, which require an instance of the outer class.",org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.withOuterClass(Class)` supports Hypothesis H1. The failure occurs because the method attempts to instantiate `SomeInnerClass` using a constructor that takes an instance of `ChildOfThis` as a parameter, but `SomeInnerClass` does not have a constructor accepting `ChildOfThis`. This indicates that `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes, which require an instance of the specific outer class (`ConstructorInstantiatorTest` in this case) rather than any subclass or different type. The method's reliance on matching the outer class instance type directly aligns with the hypothesis that the handling of non-static inner classes is flawed."
org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.newInstance(Class),0.908632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing because the `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes, which require an instance of the outer class.",org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.newInstance(Class)` supports Hypothesis H1. The test failure occurs because `SomeInnerClass` is a non-static inner class, which requires an instance of its outer class for instantiation. The method attempts to instantiate `SomeInnerClass` using `withOuterClass(cls)` when `outerClassInstance` is not null. However, the error indicates that the constructor `SomeInnerClass.<init>(ChildOfThis)` does not exist, suggesting that `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation with the appropriate outer class instance, leading to the failure."
org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.ConstructorInstantiator(Object),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing because the `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes, which require an instance of the outer class.",org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.ConstructorInstantiator(Object)` supports hypothesis H1. It initializes the `outerClassInstance` field with the provided object, which is crucial for instantiating non-static inner classes that require an instance of their outer class. The failure occurs because the `ConstructorInstantiator` is attempting to instantiate `SomeInnerClass` using an instance of `ChildOfThis`, which is not the correct outer class type, leading to a `NoSuchMethodException`. This indicates that the `ConstructorInstantiator` may not be correctly handling the requirement for the exact outer class instance."
"org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.paramsException(Class,Exception)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The test may be failing because the `ConstructorInstantiator` is not correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes, which require an instance of the outer class.",org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.creation.instance.ConstructorInstantiator.paramsException(Class,Exception)` supports hypothesis H1. It generates an `InstantationException` when instantiation fails, indicating that the `ConstructorInstantiator` might not be correctly handling the instantiation of non-static inner classes. The error message and stack trace reveal that the failure occurs due to a `NoSuchMethodException`, suggesting that the `ConstructorInstantiator` is attempting to invoke a constructor with an incorrect outer class instance (`ChildOfThis` instead of the expected outer class), which aligns with the hypothesis that the handling of non-static inner classes is flawed."
