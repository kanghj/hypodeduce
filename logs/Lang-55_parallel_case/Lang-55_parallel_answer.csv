org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.suspend(),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest::testLang315"" could be due to a race condition where the StopWatch's start and stop methods are being called in quick succession, leading to inaccurate time measurements.",org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.suspend()` contradicts Hypothesis H1 because it explicitly updates the stopwatch's state to suspended and records the current system time as the stop time, ensuring that no further time is accumulated until it is resumed. This behavior prevents any race condition between start and stop methods affecting the time measurement during the suspended state. The failure in the test is more likely due to the stopwatch not being resumed before stopping, causing `suspendTime` and `totalTime` to be equal, rather than a race condition."
org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.getTime(),0.808632,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest::testLang315"" could be due to a race condition where the StopWatch's start and stop methods are being called in quick succession, leading to inaccurate time measurements.",org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.getTime()` returns the elapsed time based on the current state of the stopwatch. If the stopwatch is in a stopped or suspended state, it calculates the time as the difference between `stopTime` and `startTime`. If the stopwatch is running, it calculates the time as the difference between the current time and `startTime`. This behavior contradicts Hypothesis H1 because the failure is not due to a race condition between start and stop calls, but rather due to the fact that `suspend()` does not stop the time, leading to `suspendTime` and `totalTime` being different when `stop()` is called after additional elapsed time."
org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.stop(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest::testLang315"" could be due to a race condition where the StopWatch's start and stop methods are being called in quick succession, leading to an inaccurate elapsed time calculation.",org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.stop()` checks if the stopwatch is in a running or suspended state before stopping, which suggests that it should handle transitions between states correctly. This contradicts Hypothesis H2, as the method's design intends to prevent stopping the stopwatch when it is not in a valid state, thus reducing the likelihood of a race condition affecting the elapsed time calculation. The failure in the test is more likely due to the `suspend()` method not freezing the time as expected, rather than a race condition between `start()` and `stop()`."
org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.start(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest::testLang315"" could be due to a race condition where the StopWatch's start and stop methods are being called in quick succession, leading to an inaccurate elapsed time calculation.",org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.start()` initializes a new timing session by setting the start time to the current system time and updating the running state. It throws an exception if the stopwatch is already started or stopped without reset, which prevents starting the stopwatch multiple times without resetting. This behavior contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it ensures that the stopwatch cannot be started in quick succession without a reset, thereby reducing the likelihood of a race condition affecting the elapsed time calculation. The failure in the test is more likely due to the `suspend()` method not pausing the time correctly, rather than a race condition between `start()` and `stop()`."
org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch.StopWatch(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatchTest::testLang315"" could be due to a race condition where the StopWatch's start and stop methods are being called in quick succession, leading to inaccurate time measurements.",org.apache.commons.lang.time.StopWatch (HH1),"The `StopWatch.StopWatch()` method, being a default constructor that only initializes the stopwatch by calling the superclass constructor, does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1. It does not involve any timing operations or method calls that could lead to a race condition. The failure in `testLang315` is more likely related to the behavior of the `suspend` and `stop` methods rather than the constructor itself, as the constructor does not influence the timing logic or the sequence of method calls."
