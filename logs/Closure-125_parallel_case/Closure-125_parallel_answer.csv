If recent changes in type inference logic incorrectly determine whether a function is a constructor, this could lead to `IllegalStateException` being thrown when `getInstanceType()` is called. In the failure context, the error occurs when `TypeCheck.visitNew()` calls `getInstanceType()`, suggesting that the type inference logic might incorrectly handle the constructor status of `A` or `B`, leading to unexpected type mismatches."

In the context of the failure, the method `getInstanceType()` in `FunctionType` calls `isInstanceType()`, which might incorrectly identify or handle the function types of `A` and `B` due to recent changes in type inference logic. This supports Hypothesis H3, as the failure could stem from a misidentification of constructor types, leading to unexpected type mismatches during the type checking process."

The failure in `testIssue1002` involves a type check error when comparing constructors `A` and `B`, suggesting that the method's handling of constructor types might be implicated. If recent changes in the type inference algorithm affect how constructor types are instantiated or compared, this method could support hypothesis H5 by being part of the altered logic that mismanages complex nested types, leading to the observed failure."

Since this method relies on `isConstructor()` and `getSuperClassConstructor()`, any modifications in these areas could lead to incorrect interface retrieval, impacting type checks. In the failure context, if `getImplementedInterfaces()` incorrectly identifies interfaces for `A` or `B`, it could cause the `IllegalStateException` during type checking, aligning with the hypothesis of mishandled edge cases."

If the logic incorrectly handles edge cases, such as misidentifying constructors or interfaces due to changes in `isConstructor()`, `isInterface()`, or `getPrototype()`, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches. The failure context involves type checking and constructor comparisons, which aligns with the method's role in determining superclass relationships."

In the failure context, both `A` and `B` are constructors implementing the interface `I`, which should satisfy the condition checked by `hasInstanceType()`. If a recent change in type inference logic incorrectly handles these constructors or interfaces, it could lead to the unexpected type mismatches observed in the test failure."

In the failure context, the `testTypes` method processes constructors `A` and `B`, and if `isConstructor()` incorrectly evaluates these types, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches. The call flow indicates that `getInstanceType()` is invoked, which relies on the correct identification of constructor types, suggesting that any recent changes affecting this logic could cause the observed failure."

In the failure context, the test involves interface implementations (`I`, `A`, and `B`), and if `isInterface()` incorrectly returns false for `A` or `B`, it could lead to unexpected type mismatches. The call flow indicates that `getInstanceType()` is involved, which relies on correctly identifying interfaces, suggesting that a recent change affecting `isInterface()` could cause the observed failure."

If `getImplementedInterfaces()` or its iteration logic has been altered, it could lead to incorrect interface collection, causing unexpected type mismatches during type checks, as seen in the failure context where `A` and `B` are compared. This aligns with the stack trace indicating issues in `FunctionType.getInstanceType()` and `TypeCheck.visitNew()`, suggesting a possible mismanagement of interface types."

If a recent change altered how this method retrieves or processes extended interfaces, it might lead to incorrect type inference, causing unexpected type mismatches as seen in the failure context. However, without specific evidence of changes to this method or its usage in the call flow leading to `TypeCheck.visitNew`, it neither directly supports nor contradicts H1."
