"org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMocksOnFields(Set,Set,Object)",0.810000,H4,0.700000,"The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the order of injection logic, prioritizing field access over property setters, contrary to the expected behavior.",org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH4),"The method `injectMocksOnFields` iterates over the fields of the test class and attempts to inject mocks into them. If the method prioritizes field access over property setters, it would contradict hypothesis H4, which expects property setters to be prioritized. The method's behavior, as described, does not explicitly mention prioritizing property setters, suggesting that recent changes might have altered the injection order, leading to the test failure. The absence of explicit prioritization for property setters in the method supports the hypothesis that the injection logic might have changed, causing the test to fail."
"org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMockCandidate(Class,Set,Object)",0.808632,H4,0.700000,"The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the order of injection logic, prioritizing field access over property setters, contrary to the expected behavior.",org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH4),"The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMockCandidate(Class,Set,Object)` iterates over all declared fields of a class and attempts to inject mocks into each field instance. This behavior supports hypothesis H4, as it indicates that the method prioritizes field access by iterating over fields first, potentially leading to the test failure if a recent change altered the injection order to prioritize fields over property setters. The method's focus on field iteration suggests that property setters might not be considered first, contradicting the expected behavior of prioritizing property setters for injection."
