## Top Suspicious Methods

1. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMocksOnFields(Set,Set,Object)** — score 0.810. best hypothesis H4: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the order of injection logic, prioritizing field access over property setters, contrary to the expected behavior. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `injectMocksOnFields` iterates over the fields of the test class and attempts to inject mocks into them. If the method prioritizes field access over property setters, it would contradict hypothesis H4, which expects property s...

2. **org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMockCandidate(Class,Set,Object)** — score 0.809. best hypothesis H4: The test failure might be caused by a recent change in the order of injection logic, prioritizing field access over property setters, contrary to the expected behavior. (confidence 0.700); supporting class org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine (HH4).
    Explanation: The method `org.mockito.internal.configuration.DefaultInjectionEngine.injectMockCandidate(Class,Set,Object)` iterates over all declared fields of a class and attempts to inject mocks into each field instance. This behavior supports hypot...
