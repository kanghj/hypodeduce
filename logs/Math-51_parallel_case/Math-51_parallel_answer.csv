The failure in `testIssue631` is due to exceeding the maximum evaluation count, suggesting that the solver struggles to converge within the given iterations, potentially because the derivative near the root is small, causing slow convergence. This behavior supports hypothesis H1, as the solver's default settings do not include specific mechanisms to handle such edge cases effectively."
