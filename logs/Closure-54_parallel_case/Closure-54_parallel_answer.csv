If recent changes in type inference logic affect how `isSubtype()` evaluates function types, especially through calls to `isInterface()`, `isConstructor()`, `getTypeOfThis()`, and `isSubtype()` on `typeOfThis` and `call`, it could lead to incorrect subtype determinations. In the context of `testIssue537a`, if `FunctionType.isSubtype()` incorrectly evaluates the relationship between `Foo.prototype.method` and its expected argument types, it could result in the observed error message about argument count mismatch."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType.defineInferredProperty(String,JSType,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases related to type annotations in the test.,com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.ObjectType.defineInferredProperty` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to the failure through its role in defining properties with inferred types. If a recent change in type inference logic affects how properties are defined or inferred, it could lead to discrepancies in expected versus actual behavior, as seen in the test failures. Specifically, if the method incorrectly infers the type or fails to recognize a property due to changes in handling type annotations, it could result in errors like ""Property baz never defined on Bar,"" which aligns with the observed test output."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases related to type annotations in the test.,com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType (HH1),"The method `defineProperty` in `PrototypeObjectType` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to the failure if recent changes in type inference logic affect how properties are defined or recognized. Specifically, if the logic for checking existing properties (`hasOwnDeclaredProperty`) or handling type annotations has been altered, it might incorrectly handle the `baz` method definition on `Bar`, leading to the error ""Property baz never defined on Bar."" The failure context suggests that the test expected a different error related to argument count, indicating a possible misalignment in how properties and their types are inferred or validated after recent changes."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.getPropertyType(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue537a"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a type mismatch error.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.getPropertyType(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the type mismatch error due to its handling of undefined properties. In the failure context, the method `baz` is reported as never defined on `Bar`, which suggests that `getPropertyType` might be returning `UNKNOWN_TYPE` when it fails to find a property slot. This behavior could lead to incorrect type inference, especially if recent changes in the type inference logic altered how `UNKNOWN_TYPE` is treated, thereby causing the observed failure in `testIssue537a`."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.hasOwnProperty(String),0.700000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases related to type annotations in the test.,com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType (HH1),"The method `hasOwnProperty(String propertyName)` checks if a property exists directly on an object by querying its local properties map. In the context of the test failure, the method supports hypothesis H2 by suggesting that the type inference logic might not correctly recognize properties defined on prototype chains, such as `baz` on `Bar.prototype`, due to recent changes. The failure message ""Property baz never defined on Bar"" indicates that the type inference might not be correctly traversing the prototype chain, potentially due to changes in how properties are checked or inferred, aligning with the hypothesis of handling edge cases related to type annotations."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.hasProperty(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue537a"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a type mismatch error.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.hasProperty(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in `testIssue537a` due to its logic for determining property existence. If the type inference logic was recently changed to incorrectly classify certain types as unknown, the method would incorrectly return true for properties that do not exist, leading to a type mismatch error. In the failure context, the method might have incorrectly determined that `Bar` has the `baz` property due to a misclassification, which aligns with the observed error message ""Property baz never defined on Bar."""
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.getSlot(String),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue537a"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a type mismatch error.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.PrototypeObjectType.getSlot(String)` supports hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure due to its recursive nature in retrieving property slots. If the type inference logic has been recently altered, it might incorrectly handle the inheritance chain or prototype properties, leading to a failure in recognizing the `baz` method on `Bar`. The method first checks the local properties map and then recursively calls on the implicit prototype, which could result in a type mismatch if the recent changes affect how these prototypes are traversed or how properties are resolved."
"com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.InstanceObjectType.defineProperty(String,JSType,boolean,Node)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue537a"" could be due to a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases, leading to unexpected type mismatches.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.InstanceObjectType (HH1),"The method `InstanceObjectType.defineProperty` supports hypothesis H4 by potentially contributing to type mismatches if recent changes in type inference logic affect how properties are defined or checked on prototypes. Specifically, if the logic for checking the implicit prototype (`getImplicitPrototype()`) or the delegation to the superclass's `defineProperty` method has changed, it could lead to incorrect assumptions about property existence or types, as seen in the failure where `baz` is reported as never defined on `Bar`. This suggests that the method's handling of property definitions might not align with the expected inheritance behavior, causing unexpected type mismatches."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType,String,JSDocInfo,JSType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheckTest::testIssue537a"" may be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles edge cases, leading to a type mismatch error.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance` supports hypothesis H1 by performing checks related to inheritance and ensuring that properties declared on a subclass have the correct `@override` annotation if they are also declared on a superclass. In the context of `testIssue537a`, the failure could be due to a recent change in type inference logic that affects how these inheritance checks are performed, potentially leading to a type mismatch error if the method incorrectly determines the presence or absence of the `@override` annotation. Specifically, the method checks if a property like `baz` is correctly inherited and annotated, which aligns with the error message indicating that ""Property baz never defined on Bar,"" suggesting a possible mishandling of inheritance logic."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.visitGetProp(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.700000,H2,0.700000,Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the type inference logic that incorrectly handles specific edge cases related to type annotations in the test.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH1),"The method `visitGetProp(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` processes GETPROP nodes, which are associated with property access in JavaScript. It relies on the context provided by `NodeTraversal` to perform name lookups and error reporting. If recent changes in type inference logic affect how types are assigned or checked for these nodes, it could lead to incorrect handling of type annotations, as seen in the test failures. Specifically, the failure in `testIssue537a` suggests that the method might not correctly recognize or handle the inheritance and method definitions, potentially due to changes in how type information is propagated or validated for properties like `baz` on `Bar`."
