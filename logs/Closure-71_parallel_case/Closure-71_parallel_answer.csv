"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.checkPropertyVisibility(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `checkPropertyVisibility(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` evaluates whether a property is accessible in the current context by examining the property's visibility and the context in which it is accessed. If the method incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations, it could support Hypothesis H1 by indicating a flaw in the logic that determines property visibility. Specifically, if the method misinterprets the context or the property's visibility due to recent changes, it could lead to false positives, such as the failure in `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties6`, where a private property is incorrectly flagged as being overridden. The method's reliance on `ObjectType` and `dereference` suggests that any recent changes in these areas could affect its behavior, potentially leading to the observed test failures."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.checkNameVisibility(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `checkNameVisibility(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H1 as it is responsible for determining the visibility of a name in the current context, which directly relates to access control logic. If there was a recent change in how this method evaluates visibility, it could incorrectly flag valid private property accesses as violations. The method uses `t.getScope().getVar(name.getString())` to retrieve variable information, and any modification in how this scope or variable information is interpreted could lead to the observed test failures, such as incorrectly identifying private property overrides."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.visit(NodeTraversal,Node,Node)",0.800000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid property accesses as violations due to an overly restrictive rule.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.visit(NodeTraversal, Node, Node)` supports hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the failure through its logic for checking name visibility, which could have been recently modified to be more restrictive. The method processes each node and specifically calls `checkNameVisibility`, which is responsible for enforcing access control rules. If recent changes made this logic overly strict, it could incorrectly flag valid property accesses as violations, aligning with the observed test failures where private properties are incorrectly flagged when overridden."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.CheckAccessControls(AbstractCompiler),0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.CheckAccessControls(AbstractCompiler)` initializes components related to access control checks, including the compiler and type validator. If a recent change in this initialization logic altered how private properties are validated, it could lead to incorrect flagging of valid private property accesses as violations. The failure in `testNoPrivateAccessForProperties6` suggests that the logic now incorrectly identifies overriding a private property as a violation, supporting hypothesis H1."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.enterScope(NodeTraversal),0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid property accesses as violations due to an overly restrictive rule.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `enterScope(NodeTraversal)` supports hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the failure through its role in updating the current class context and checking for deprecated functions. If a recent change in the access control logic affects how the current class context is determined or how deprecated functions are identified, it could lead to incorrect flagging of valid property accesses as violations. Specifically, if `getClassOfMethod` or the logic determining the scope context has been altered to be more restrictive, it might incorrectly interpret the overriding of private properties as violations, aligning with the observed test failure."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.process(Node,Node)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.process(Node, Node)` initiates a traversal of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using `NodeTraversal`, with `CheckAccessControls` acting as the callback handler. This suggests that the method is responsible for checking access controls during the traversal. If there was a recent change in the logic within `CheckAccessControls` that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses, it could lead to the observed test failures. The method's role in traversing and checking access controls supports the hypothesis that a change in this logic might be causing valid private property accesses to be incorrectly flagged as violations."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.getClassOfMethod(Node,Node)",0.700000,H3,0.700000,Hypothesis H3: The failure might be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid property accesses as violations due to an overly restrictive rule.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.getClassOfMethod(Node, Node)` supports Hypothesis H3 by potentially contributing to the failure through its role in determining the class ownership of a method. If a recent change in access control logic altered how this method normalizes or identifies class types, it could incorrectly flag valid property accesses as violations. Specifically, if the normalization process or class type determination became more restrictive, it might misinterpret the context of private property overrides, leading to the observed test failures."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.checkConstantProperty(NodeTraversal,Node)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.checkConstantProperty(NodeTraversal, Node)` focuses on verifying reassignment of properties marked as `@const`, which is unrelated to the access control logic for private properties. This method does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1, as it does not handle private property access checks. The failure in the test is due to the `JSC_PRIVATE_OVERRIDE` error, which suggests that the issue lies in the logic handling private property overrides, not constant property checks."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.exitScope(NodeTraversal),0.300000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.exitScope(NodeTraversal)` primarily deals with scope management and deprecated function checks, rather than directly handling access control logic for private properties. Its role in resetting the current class context might indirectly influence access control checks, but it does not directly support or contradict Hypothesis H1. The failure described in the test seems more related to the logic that determines property access violations, which is not directly addressed by the `exitScope` method. Therefore, the method's functionality does not provide concrete evidence for or against the hypothesis regarding changes in access control logic."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls.normalizeClassType(JSType),0.300000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a recent change in the access control logic that incorrectly flags valid private property accesses as violations.,com.google.javascript.jscomp.CheckAccessControls (HH1),"The method `normalizeClassType(JSType)` is designed to standardize the type representation of constructors, instances, or prototypes to their instance types, which is crucial for consistent type checking. If a recent change in access control logic incorrectly flags valid private property accesses, it could be due to improper normalization of types, leading to misinterpretation of access levels. However, since `normalizeClassType` focuses on type normalization rather than access control directly, it is unlikely to directly cause the failure unless it inadvertently affects how types are interpreted in access control checks."
