org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createNumber(String),0.800000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test ""testStringCreateNumberEnsureNoPrecisionLoss"" may be failing due to a recent change in the method handling string-to-number conversion, which could be introducing precision loss for certain numeric string inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createNumber(String)` is designed to convert a string into a `java.lang.Number` by determining the most appropriate numeric type based on the input string. The test failure suggests that the method might not be correctly identifying the string ""3.40282354e+38"" as a `Double`, possibly due to a recent change affecting how the method interprets scientific notation or large floating-point numbers. This could lead to precision loss or incorrect type assignment, contradicting hypothesis H1, as the method should ideally return a `Double` for such inputs without precision issues."
org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createFloat(String),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test ""testStringCreateNumberEnsureNoPrecisionLoss"" may be failing due to a recent change in the method handling string-to-number conversion, which could be introducing precision loss for certain numeric string inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.createFloat(String)` converts a `String` to a `Float` using `Float.valueOf(str)`. This method does not directly support hypothesis H1, as it does not introduce precision loss beyond the inherent limitations of the `Float` type itself. The test failure occurs with a `Double` conversion, not a `Float`, suggesting that the issue may lie elsewhere, possibly in the handling of the `Double` conversion rather than a recent change in `createFloat`."
org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isBlank(CharSequence),0.100000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The test ""testStringCreateNumberEnsureNoPrecisionLoss"" may be failing due to a recent change in the method handling string-to-number conversion, which could be introducing precision loss for certain numeric string inputs.",org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils.isBlank(CharSequence)` checks if a given `CharSequence` is either null, empty, or consists solely of whitespace. This method does not directly relate to the hypothesis H1, as it does not perform any string-to-number conversion or affect numeric precision. The failure in the test `testStringCreateNumberEnsureNoPrecisionLoss` is likely unrelated to `isBlank`, as the test involves numeric conversion and precision, while `isBlank` deals only with checking the presence of non-whitespace characters in a string."
