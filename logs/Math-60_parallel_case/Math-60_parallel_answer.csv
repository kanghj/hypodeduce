org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.cumulativeProbability(double),0.800000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testExtremeValues"" may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling very large or very small floating-point numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `cumulativeProbability(double x)` in `NormalDistributionImpl` supports hypothesis H1, as it involves calculating the error function `Erf.erf`, which is known to suffer from numerical instability and precision loss for extreme values. The failure context indicates a `ConvergenceException` due to divergence to NaN, which suggests that the method struggles with very large or small values of `x`, particularly when `x` is far from the mean. This aligns with the method's behavior of returning 0 or 1 when `x` is more than 40 standard deviations from the mean, indicating potential precision issues in handling extreme tails of the distribution."
"org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.NormalDistributionImpl(double,double)",0.300000,H1,0.800000,"H1: The failure in ""org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionTest::testExtremeValues"" may be caused by numerical instability or precision loss when handling very large or very small floating-point numbers.",org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `NormalDistributionImpl(double, double)` initializes a normal distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation, which are passed to the three-argument constructor `NormalDistributionImpl(double, double, double)`. This constructor sets up the distribution parameters and likely involves calculations that could be sensitive to numerical precision, especially when handling extreme values. In the test `testExtremeValues`, the failure occurs due to a `ConvergenceException` when evaluating the cumulative probability for large values, suggesting that the constructor's handling of extreme values might contribute to numerical instability or precision loss, supporting hypothesis H1."
"org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl.NormalDistributionImpl(double,double,double)",0.300000,H5,0.700000,Hypothesis H5: The failure may be caused by an incorrect handling of floating-point precision limits when dealing with extreme values in the NormalDistribution implementation.,org.apache.commons.math.distribution.NormalDistributionImpl (HH1),"The method `NormalDistributionImpl(double, double, double)` initializes a normal distribution with specified parameters, including inverse cumulative accuracy, but does not directly handle floating-point precision limits. The failure context indicates a `ConvergenceException` due to divergence to NaN, suggesting issues in handling extreme values, likely in the cumulative probability calculations. Since the constructor only sets parameters and does not involve calculations or precision handling, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H5 directly. The issue likely arises in subsequent calculations, such as those involving the `Erf.erf` method, where precision limits are more relevant."
