org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.answer(InvocationOnMock),0.810000,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a serialization issue where the deep stubbed mock objects are not correctly implementing the `Serializable` interface, leading to an exception during the serialization or deserialization process.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.answer(InvocationOnMock)` supports hypothesis H1. The method attempts to return a mock object for a given invocation by checking if the return type is mockable. If it is, it creates or retrieves a deep stub mock. However, if these deep stub mock objects do not correctly implement the `Serializable` interface, it can lead to a `NotSerializableException` during serialization, as seen in the stack trace. The exception indicates that the deep stubbed mock objects, specifically the anonymous inner class `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`, are not serializable, aligning with the hypothesis that serialization issues are causing the failure."

This method is responsible for creating new mock instances with specific settings, including deep stubs. If these mock instances do not correctly implement the `Serializable` interface, it can lead to serialization issues, as indicated by the `NotSerializableException` in the stack trace. The failure occurs because the deep stubbed mock objects, created with specific settings, are not serializable, which aligns with the hypothesis that serialization issues are causing the exception."
"org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.getMock(InvocationOnMock,GenericMetadataSupport)",0.806842,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a serialization issue where the deep stubbed mock objects are not correctly implementing the `Serializable` interface, leading to an exception during the serialization or deserialization process.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.getMock(InvocationOnMock, GenericMetadataSupport)` supports hypothesis H1. The method involves creating new deep stub mocks using `createNewDeepStubMock` when no existing stubbed invocation matches. If these newly created deep stub mocks do not correctly implement the `Serializable` interface, it could lead to a `NotSerializableException` during serialization, as seen in the failure context. The stack trace indicates that the exception occurs due to an object related to `ReturnsDeepStubs`, suggesting that the deep stubbed mocks might not be fully serializable."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing(GenericMetadataSupport),0.804526,H1,0.700000,"H1: The failure might be caused by a serialization issue where the deep stubbed mock objects are not correctly implementing the `Serializable` interface, leading to an exception during the serialization or deserialization process.",org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `returnsDeepStubsAnswerUsing(GenericMetadataSupport)` creates an instance of `ReturnsDeepStubs` that is not inherently serializable, as indicated by the `NotSerializableException` for `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure is likely due to the deep stubbed mock objects not implementing the `Serializable` interface correctly, causing an exception during serialization. The stack trace shows the error occurring when attempting to serialize the mock, aligning with the hypothesis that serialization issues are the root cause."
"org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.recordDeepStubMock(Object,InvocationContainerImpl)",0.700000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in serialization compatibility between the mock object created by deep stubs and the expected serialized format due to changes in the underlying class structure or serialization mechanism.,org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.recordDeepStubMock(Object, InvocationContainerImpl)` supports Hypothesis H4 by indicating that the mock object is recorded in a way that ensures it is returned for future invocations. However, the failure occurs because the mock created with deep stubs is not serializable, as evidenced by the `NotSerializableException`. This suggests a mismatch in serialization compatibility, aligning with H4, since the deep stub mechanism involves complex internal structures that may not align with the expected serialized format. The method's role in recording the mock does not directly address serialization compatibility, highlighting a potential gap in handling serialization for deep stubs."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.withSettingsUsing(GenericMetadataSupport),0.700000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in serialization compatibility between the mock object created by deep stubs and the expected serialized format due to changes in the underlying class structure or serialization mechanism.,org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.withSettingsUsing(GenericMetadataSupport)` configures mock settings by incorporating extra interfaces and setting the default answer, which suggests it is primarily concerned with mock configuration rather than serialization compatibility. The failure, indicated by `java.io.NotSerializableException`, suggests that the serialization issue arises from the mock's internal structure, specifically the `ReturnsDeepStubs$2` class, which is not serializable. This supports Hypothesis H4, as the serialization failure is likely due to the mock's internal structure not aligning with the expected serialized format, rather than any configuration mismatch handled by `withSettingsUsing`."
org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.actualParameterizedType(Object),0.300000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure might be caused by a mismatch in serialization compatibility between the mock object created by deep stubs and the expected serialized format due to changes in the underlying class structure or serialization mechanism.,org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs (HH1),"The method `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs.actualParameterizedType(Object)` supports Hypothesis H4 by highlighting potential serialization issues related to type inference. This method extracts generic metadata from the mock's creation settings, which could lead to serialization mismatches if the inferred type does not align with the expected serialized format. In the failure context, the `NotSerializableException` indicates that the serialization mechanism might not handle the deep stubs' inferred types correctly, suggesting a compatibility issue with the mock's type metadata."
