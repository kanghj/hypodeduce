This suggests that for very large positive input values, the method might still produce results that are close to the theoretical value, but it does not explicitly handle overflow scenarios. Therefore, if the input values in `testMath905LargePositive` are large enough to cause overflow, the method might return `Infinity`, supporting the hypothesis H1 that the failure could be due to an overflow error when handling very large positive input values."

In the context of hypothesis H1, this method does not directly address overflow issues that occur with very large input values, as it focuses on precision enhancement. The failure in `testMath905LargePositive` likely arises from the inability of the `FastMath.cosh` function to handle extremely large values without exceeding the representable range, leading to an overflow, which is not directly mitigated by the precision-focused `exp` method."

If `a` is very large, the series terms can grow significantly, potentially leading to overflow errors or loss of precision, especially if the implementation does not adequately manage the precision or range of intermediate results. This behavior supports hypothesis H1, as the failure in `testMath905LargePositive` could indeed be due to such overflow issues when handling very large positive input values, resulting in incorrect calculations or unexpected behavior."
