In the test, `G.prototype.foo` is defined without parameters, but the call `(new G()).foo(1);` passes one argument, leading to a mismatch. If `getMinArguments()` incorrectly infers that `G.prototype.foo` requires arguments due to inheritance from `F.prototype.foo`, it could result in the observed error, indicating improper handling of method signatures."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getMaxArguments(),0.700000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testMethodInference6"" might be due to incorrect or incomplete type inference logic in the LooseTypeCheck module, leading to improper handling of method signatures during the test.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.getMaxArguments()` supports hypothesis H2 by potentially contributing to the failure in ""testMethodInference6"" through its logic for determining the maximum number of arguments a function can accept. In the test, `G.prototype.foo` is defined without parameters, leading `getMaxArguments()` to return 0, which contradicts the call `(new G()).foo(1)` with one argument. This discrepancy suggests that the type inference logic might not correctly handle overridden methods with differing parameter counts, aligning with the hypothesis of improper handling of method signatures."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMethodInference6"" might be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic in the LooseTypeCheck module, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual inferred types during method analysis.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.isSubtype(JSType)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to the failure in `testMethodInference6` through its role in determining subtype relationships between function types. In this context, the method checks if the function `G.prototype.foo` is a subtype of `F.prototype.foo`, which requires matching parameter types and counts. The failure indicates a mismatch in expected argument counts (0 for `G.prototype.foo` vs. 1 for `F.prototype.foo`), suggesting that the subtype logic might not correctly account for overridden methods with differing parameter lists, thus supporting the hypothesis of incorrect or incomplete type inference logic."
com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setPrototypeBasedOn(ObjectType),0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMethodInference6"" might be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic in the LooseTypeCheck module, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual inferred types during method analysis.",com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.rhino.jstype.FunctionType.setPrototypeBasedOn(ObjectType)` supports Hypothesis H1 by potentially contributing to incorrect type inference. This method sets the prototype of a function type based on a given base type, which could lead to mismatches if the base type is not accurately determined or if the prototype chain is not correctly established. In the failure context, `G.prototype.foo` is expected to override `F.prototype.foo`, but the type inference logic might not correctly propagate the parameter type from `F` to `G`, resulting in the argument count mismatch error observed in the test."

In the failure context, `G.prototype.foo` is defined without parameters, but it is called with one argument, leading to a mismatch. If `createFunctionType` is invoked with `null` for parameters, it might not correctly infer the expected parameter types, resulting in the observed error. This suggests that the type inference logic might not be handling parameter specifications accurately, aligning with the hypothesis of an incomplete type inference logic in the LooseTypeCheck module."
"com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck.checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance(NodeTraversal,Node,FunctionType,String,JSDocInfo,JSType)",0.700000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testMethodInference6"" might be caused by an incorrect or incomplete type inference logic in the LooseTypeCheck module, leading to a mismatch between expected and actual inferred types during method analysis.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.TypeCheck (HH3),"The method `checkDeclaredPropertyInheritance` supports hypothesis H1 by performing checks on whether a property with the `@override` annotation is correctly declared on a superclass. In the failure context, `G.prototype.foo` is incorrectly overriding `F.prototype.foo` without matching the parameter signature, leading to a type mismatch. The method's role in verifying inheritance correctness suggests that if the type inference logic is flawed, it could result in the observed mismatch, as the method relies on accurate type information to validate overrides. The failure indicates that the method might not be correctly identifying or handling the parameter count discrepancy between `F.prototype.foo` and `G.prototype.foo`."

The method's switch-case structure processes different parse tree nodes, which could lead to incorrect type inference if the logic for handling overridden methods (like `G.prototype.foo`) is flawed. Specifically, the error message indicates a mismatch in expected argument counts, suggesting that the method might not correctly infer or propagate the parameter types from the overridden method in `F.prototype.foo` to `G.prototype.foo`."

In the test failure, `G.prototype.foo` is overridden without parameters, while `F.prototype.foo` expects a parameter. The method `visitAssign` changes the schema of the object type when a prototype modification is detected, which might not correctly handle the parameter mismatch between `F.prototype.foo` and `G.prototype.foo`, leading to the observed argument count error. This suggests that the type inference logic might not fully account for overridden methods with differing parameter requirements."

In the context of the failure in `testMethodInference6`, this method identifies a mismatch between the number of arguments passed to `G.prototype.foo` and the expected number of arguments (0) as defined in the overridden method. This supports hypothesis H1, as the failure arises from the type inference logic not correctly handling the overridden method's parameter expectations, leading to a warning about the wrong argument count. The method's logic directly contributes to identifying this mismatch, indicating a potential issue in how the type inference handles method overrides."

In the context of the failure in `testMethodInference6`, this method supports hypothesis H1 because it directly influences how function types are constructed and inferred, particularly regarding parameter expectations. The mismatch in argument count for `G.prototype.foo` suggests that the type inference logic might not correctly propagate or override parameter information from `F.prototype.foo`, leading to the observed discrepancy in expected versus actual argument requirements."
