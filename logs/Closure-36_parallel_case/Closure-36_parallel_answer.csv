com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.getSingletonGetterClassName(Node),0.700000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" could be due to recent changes in the singleton pattern implementation that are not compatible with the test's expectations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `getSingletonGetterClassName(Node)` supports Hypothesis H4 by potentially identifying discrepancies between the expected and actual singleton pattern implementations. If recent changes altered the pattern such that the `callNode` no longer matches the expected Closure singleton getter pattern, the method would return `null`, leading to test failures. In the context of `testSingletonGetter1`, if the `callNode` structure or naming conventions have changed due to recent updates, the method might not recognize the pattern, thus supporting the hypothesis that the failure is due to incompatibility with recent changes."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.getClassesDefinedByCall(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, causing it to not initialize or return the expected instance correctly.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.getClassesDefinedByCall(Node)` is focused on identifying class relationships in code according to Closure conventions, which involves recognizing inheritance or mixin patterns. This method does not directly interact with or modify the singleton pattern's behavior, as it primarily deals with class definitions rather than instance management. Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in this method would directly cause the singleton pattern to fail in initializing or returning the expected instance, contradicting hypothesis H1. The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" is more likely related to changes elsewhere in the codebase that affect instance creation or retrieval logic."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.ClosureCodingConvention(),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, leading to unexpected interactions or state inconsistencies during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.ClosureCodingConvention()` initializes the coding convention to the default settings, which suggests that any recent changes affecting the singleton pattern behavior would not originate from this constructor itself. Instead, the method ensures that the coding convention is consistent with the default behavior expected by the test. Therefore, if the failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" is due to a recent change, it is more likely related to modifications elsewhere in the codebase that interact with or override the default coding convention settings established by this constructor."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.describeFunctionBind(Node),0.300000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, causing it to not initialize or return the expected instance correctly.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.describeFunctionBind(Node)` primarily deals with describing function bindings specific to Closure patterns, such as `goog.bind` or `goog.partial`. It does not directly interact with or modify the singleton pattern implementation, which involves `goog.addSingletonGetter`. Therefore, this method neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not influence the initialization or return behavior of singleton instances. The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" is more likely related to changes in how singleton patterns are optimized or transformed, rather than function binding descriptions."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.typeofClassDefiningName(Node),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, leading to unexpected interactions or state inconsistencies during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `ClosureCodingConvention.typeofClassDefiningName(Node)` checks if a node represents a class-defining method name, such as ""inherits"" or ""mixin"", and returns a `SubclassType` or null. This method does not directly interact with singleton patterns or their instantiation logic, as it focuses on class inheritance and mixin patterns. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H2, as it does not influence the singleton pattern behavior or its recent changes in the codebase."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.ClosureCodingConvention(CodingConvention),0.300000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, leading to unexpected interactions or state inconsistencies during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `ClosureCodingConvention.ClosureCodingConvention(CodingConvention)` initializes the `ClosureCodingConvention` by wrapping an existing `CodingConvention`, which suggests that it does not directly alter the behavior of the singleton pattern itself. Instead, it relies on the existing conventions provided by the `CodingConvention` parameter. Therefore, this method does not support Hypothesis H2, as it does not introduce changes to the singleton pattern's behavior; any recent changes affecting the singleton pattern would likely originate elsewhere in the codebase, not from this constructor."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.getAssertionFunctions(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,"Hypothesis H1: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" could be due to a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, causing it to not initialize or return the expected instance correctly.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.getAssertionFunctions()` provides a collection of assertion function specifications, which are unrelated to the singleton pattern's initialization or instance return behavior. This method focuses on mapping assertion function names to expected types, not on modifying or affecting singleton logic. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not interact with or influence the singleton pattern's behavior directly."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.isOptionalParameter(Node),0.200000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" might be caused by a recent change in the codebase that altered the behavior of the singleton pattern, leading to unexpected interactions or state inconsistencies during the test execution.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.isOptionalParameter(Node)` always returns false, which means it does not recognize any parameters as optional under the Closure coding convention. This behavior supports Hypothesis H2 by suggesting that if a recent change in the codebase altered how parameters are treated (e.g., introducing optional parameters), it would not be recognized by this method, potentially leading to unexpected interactions or state inconsistencies in the singleton pattern during test execution. The consistent return value of false implies that any deviation from expected behavior due to parameter handling changes would not be mitigated by this method."
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.isVarArgsParameter(Node),0.200000,H4,0.700000,"Hypothesis H4: The failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" could be due to recent changes in the singleton pattern implementation that are not compatible with the test's expectations.",com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention (HH1),"The method `com.google.javascript.jscomp.ClosureCodingConvention.isVarArgsParameter(Node)` always returns false, indicating that it does not recognize any parameter as variadic. This behavior suggests that the failure in ""testSingletonGetter1"" is unlikely related to changes in handling variadic parameters within the singleton pattern implementation. Since the method's behavior remains unchanged, it does not support the hypothesis H4 that recent changes in the singleton pattern implementation are causing the test failure. The issue likely lies elsewhere, possibly in the transformation or optimization process applied to the code."
