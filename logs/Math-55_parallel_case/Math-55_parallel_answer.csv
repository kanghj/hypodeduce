"org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.crossProduct(Vector3D,Vector3D)",0.800000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.crossProduct(Vector3D, Vector3D)` supports hypothesis H1, as the test failure likely results from numerical precision errors when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors. In the test case, vectors `v1` and `v2` have very similar components, which can lead to small differences being lost due to floating-point precision limitations. The assertion failure, where the expected result was `<1.0>` but the actual result was `<0.0>`, indicates that the precision error affected the computation, causing the cross product to incorrectly evaluate to zero."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.Vector3DFormat(NumberFormat),0.100000,H2,0.700000,"Hypothesis H2: The failure might be caused by floating-point precision errors during the calculation of the cross product, leading to inaccurate results when vectors are nearly parallel.",org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat (HH2),"The method `Vector3DFormat(Vector3DFormat(NumberFormat))` is unrelated to the hypothesis H2 about floating-point precision errors in cross product calculations. This method is concerned with formatting the output of vector components using a custom number format, not with the computation of the cross product itself. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts H2, as it does not influence the arithmetic operations or precision handling during the cross product calculation."
"org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.Vector3DFormat(String,String,String,NumberFormat)",0.100000,H4,0.700000,Hypothesis H4: The failure may be caused by numerical instability or precision errors in the cross product calculation when dealing with very small or very large vector magnitudes.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.Vector3DFormat(String,String,String,NumberFormat)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H4 concerning numerical instability or precision errors in cross product calculations. This method is responsible for formatting `Vector3D` objects with custom strings and number formats, which does not influence the mathematical operations or precision of vector calculations. The failure in the test is more likely due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic when handling very large or very small numbers, rather than the formatting of the output."
"org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.Vector3D(double,double,double)",0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D (HH1),"The method `Vector3D.Vector3D(double x, double y, double z)` constructs a vector using the provided coordinates without any additional processing or error handling for numerical precision. This supports Hypothesis H1, as the test failure could be due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors like `v1` and `v2`. The small differences in their coordinates can lead to significant precision errors, resulting in unexpected zero values in the cross product calculation."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getX(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getX()` simply returns the x-coordinate of a vector and does not perform any arithmetic operations. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve any calculations that could introduce numerical precision errors. The test failure is more likely related to the arithmetic operations in the `Vector3D.crossProduct` method, where the precision errors could occur due to the subtraction of nearly equal floating-point numbers, rather than the retrieval of the x-coordinate itself."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getY(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getY()` simply returns the y-coordinate of a vector and does not perform any arithmetic operations. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve any computation that could introduce numerical precision errors. The test failure is more likely related to the arithmetic operations in the `Vector3D.crossProduct` method, where the precision errors could occur due to the subtraction of nearly equal large numbers, rather than the retrieval of the y-coordinate itself."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getZ(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3D.getZ()` simply returns the z-coordinate of a vector and does not perform any arithmetic operations. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1 directly, as it does not involve any calculations that could introduce numerical precision errors. The test failure likely arises from the cross product computation itself, where the nearly parallel vectors `v1` and `v2` could lead to precision issues, especially given their large magnitude and close values."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.getInstance(),0.000000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.getInstance()` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 regarding numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic. This method is concerned with obtaining a default 3D vector format based on the current locale, which is a formatting operation and does not influence the arithmetic computations or precision of the cross product operation. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts the hypothesis about precision errors in the cross product calculation of nearly parallel vectors."
org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.getInstance(Locale),0.000000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat (HH2),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.geometry.Vector3DFormat.getInstance(Locale)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 regarding numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic. This method is concerned with formatting 3D vectors for a specific locale, which involves locale-specific number formatting, and does not influence the computation of the cross product or address numerical precision issues. The test failure in question is likely due to the inherent limitations of floating-point arithmetic when dealing with nearly parallel vectors, which is unrelated to the locale-based formatting provided by `getInstance(Locale)`."
org.apache.commons.math.util.CompositeFormat.getDefaultNumberFormat(Locale),0.000000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The test failure may be caused by numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors.,org.apache.commons.math.util.CompositeFormat (HH4),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.util.CompositeFormat.getDefaultNumberFormat(Locale)` is unrelated to the hypothesis H1 regarding numerical precision errors in floating-point arithmetic. This method deals with formatting numbers for display purposes by setting the maximum number of fraction digits to 2, which does not affect the internal precision of floating-point calculations. The test failure in `testCrossProductCancellation` is likely due to precision issues inherent in floating-point arithmetic when computing the cross product of nearly parallel vectors, rather than any formatting applied by this method."
