org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.ebeMultiply(RealVector),0.900000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.ebeMultiply(RealVector)` supports Hypothesis H1. The stack trace indicates a `ConcurrentModificationException` is thrown during the execution of `ebeMultiply`, specifically when iterating over the entries of the `OpenMapRealVector`. This suggests that the internal data structure of the vector is being modified concurrently, leading to an inconsistent state. The method's reliance on iterating over the vector's entries without proper synchronization or handling of concurrent modifications aligns with the hypothesis that a race condition could cause the failure."
"org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.setEntry(int,double)",0.300000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `setEntry(int index, double value)` modifies the internal data structure of `OpenMapRealVector` by adding or updating entries in the `entries` map. This supports Hypothesis H1, as concurrent calls to `setEntry` could lead to race conditions if multiple threads modify the `entries` map simultaneously. The test code does not explicitly show concurrent execution, but if such concurrency exists, it could result in the ""map has been modified while iterating"" exception observed in the stack trace."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(OpenMapRealVector),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `OpenMapRealVector(OpenMapRealVector v)` is a copy constructor that creates a new `OpenMapRealVector` instance by copying the internal data structure (`OpenIntToDoubleHashMap`) from the provided instance `v`. This supports Hypothesis H1 because if the original vector `v` is being modified concurrently while the copy is being made, it could lead to inconsistencies or corruption in the copied data structure. The stack trace indicates a concurrent modification exception, which aligns with the possibility of a race condition occurring during the copying or iteration process in the `ebeMultiply` method."
"org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.OpenMapRealVector(int,double)",0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `OpenMapRealVector(int, double)` initializes a new vector with all entries set to zero and sets an epsilon tolerance, without invoking any other methods that could modify the vector's internal state. This supports Hypothesis H1 by indicating that the initial construction of the vector is not directly responsible for concurrent modifications. The error likely arises from operations performed after the vector's creation, such as `ebeMultiply`, which may involve iterating over the vector's internal data structure, potentially leading to a race condition if concurrent modifications occur."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntries(),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntries()` returns the internal `OpenIntToDoubleHashMap` that stores the vector's entries, which supports hypothesis H1. By exposing the internal data structure directly, it allows external code to potentially modify the map concurrently, leading to a race condition. This can result in inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution, as evidenced by the `ConcurrentModificationException` thrown when `ebeMultiply` is called."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntry(int),0.200000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getEntry(int)` supports hypothesis H1 by ensuring that the index is valid before accessing the internal data structure, but it does not directly modify the data structure. Since it only retrieves values and does not involve any concurrent modifications, it does not directly contribute to a race condition. However, if other methods concurrently modify the vector while `getEntry` is being called, it could lead to inconsistent reads, indirectly supporting the hypothesis of a race condition causing the failure."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getDimension(),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.getDimension()` simply returns the virtual size of the vector and does not interact with or modify the internal data structure of the vector. Since it does not involve any iteration or modification of the vector's internal map, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1. The failure described in the test is related to concurrent modifications during iteration, which is unrelated to the static nature of the `getDimension()` method."
org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.isDefaultValue(double),0.100000,H1,0.700000,Hypothesis H1: The failure may be caused by a race condition where concurrent modifications to the SparseRealVector's internal data structure lead to inconsistent or corrupted state during test execution.,org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector (HH1),"The method `org.apache.commons.math.linear.OpenMapRealVector.isDefaultValue(double)` checks if a given value is effectively zero within a specified epsilon tolerance. It does not interact with or modify the internal data structure of `SparseRealVector`. Therefore, it neither supports nor contradicts Hypothesis H1, as it does not involve any concurrent modifications or race conditions. The method's role is limited to value comparison, and it does not contribute to the state changes that could lead to the failure described."
