1) explanation for test one:

The test method `should_throw_friendly_reminder_exception_when_duration_is_negative` is designed to verify that creating a `Timer` object with a negative duration value results in a `FriendlyReminderException` being thrown. Here's a detailed breakdown of the test logic:

- The test begins by attempting to create a new instance of the `Timer` class with a duration of `-1`. This is done using the constructor `new Timer(-1)`.
- The expectation is that the constructor of the `Timer` class should check for negative duration values and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the duration is negative.
- If the `Timer` object is created without throwing an exception, the test will reach the line `Assert.fail(""It is forbidden to create timer with negative value of timer's duration."");`. This line will cause the test to fail because it indicates that the expected exception was not thrown.
- If the `FriendlyReminderException` is correctly thrown by the `Timer` constructor, the test will catch this exception in the `catch` block.
- Inside the `catch` block, the test asserts `Assert.assertTrue(true);`, which effectively means the test has passed because the expected exception was thrown.

The failure of this test suggests that the `Timer` constructor is not throwing a `FriendlyReminderException` when a negative duration is provided. This could be due to a missing or incorrect validation check in the `Timer` class constructor.

Unfortunately, there are no test utility methods provided in the information, so we cannot analyze any additional utility methods that might be involved in this test.

Let's analyze the situation step by step:

### Analysis of the Test Code and Failure

1. **Test Objective**: The test is designed to ensure that the `Timer` class throws a `FriendlyReminderException` when initialized with a negative duration. This is a common validation check to prevent invalid state in objects.

2. **Test Failure**: The test fails because the `Timer` constructor does not throw the expected exception when a negative duration is provided. Instead, the code execution reaches the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that no exception was thrown.

3. **Stack Trace and Output**: The stack trace points to the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the expected exception was not thrown. There is no additional output, which is consistent with the test's failure due to the absence of the exception.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the test's purpose and the failure, the likely defect in the production code is within the `Timer` class constructor. Here are the possible issues:

1. **Missing Validation Check**: The `Timer` constructor might be missing a validation check for negative duration values. This check should be implemented to ensure that any negative value results in a `FriendlyReminderException`.

2. **Incorrect Exception Handling**: If there is a validation check, it might not be correctly implemented to throw the `FriendlyReminderException`. The constructor should explicitly throw this exception when a negative duration is detected.

3. **Logic Error**: There could be a logic error in the condition that checks the duration value. For example, the condition might be incorrectly written, or the exception might be thrown under the wrong circumstances.

### Recommendation

To address the defect, review and modify the `Timer` class constructor as follows:

- **Add Validation**: Ensure that there is a validation check at the beginning of the constructor to verify if the duration is negative.

- **Throw Exception**: If the duration is negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message.

Here is a conceptual example of how the constructor might be corrected:

```java
public class Timer {
    public Timer(int duration) {
        if (duration < 0) {
            throw new FriendlyReminderException(""Duration cannot be negative."");
        }
        // Existing constructor logic...
    }
}
```

By implementing these changes, the `Timer` class will correctly handle negative duration values, and the test should pass, confirming the fix."

1. **Test Objective**: The test is designed to ensure that the `Timer` class throws a `FriendlyReminderException` when initialized with a negative duration. This is a common validation check to prevent invalid state in objects.

2. **Test Failure**: The test fails because the `Timer` constructor does not throw the expected exception when a negative duration is provided. Instead, the code execution reaches the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that no exception was thrown.

3. **Stack Trace and Output**: The stack trace points to the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the expected exception was not thrown. There is no additional output, which is consistent with the test's failure due to the absence of the exception.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the test's purpose and the failure, the likely defect in the production code is within the `Timer` class constructor. Here are the possible issues:

1. **Missing Validation Check**: The `Timer` constructor might be missing a validation check for negative duration values. This check should be implemented to ensure that any negative value results in a `FriendlyReminderException`.

2. **Incorrect Exception Handling**: If there is a validation check, it might not be correctly implemented to throw the `FriendlyReminderException`. The constructor should explicitly throw this exception when a negative duration is detected.

3. **Logic Error**: There could be a logic error in the condition that checks the duration value. For example, the condition might be incorrectly written, or the exception might be thrown under the wrong circumstances.

### Recommendation

To address the defect, review and modify the `Timer` class constructor as follows:

- **Add Validation**: Ensure that there is a validation check at the beginning of the constructor to verify if the duration is negative.

- **Throw Exception**: If the duration is negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message.

Here is a conceptual example of how the constructor might be corrected:

```java
public class Timer {
    public Timer(int duration) {
        if (duration < 0) {
            throw new FriendlyReminderException(""Duration cannot be negative."");
        }
        // Existing constructor logic...
    }
}
```

By implementing these changes, the `Timer` class will correctly handle negative duration values, and the test should pass, confirming the fix."""

1) Explanation for test one:

The test method `should_throw_exception_when_duration_is_negative_for_timeout_method` is designed to verify that the `Mockito.timeout()` method throws an exception when it is called with a negative duration value. The test logic is as follows:

- The test begins by attempting to call `Mockito.timeout(-1)`. The expectation here is that this call should not be allowed, as a negative duration does not make sense in the context of a timeout.
- If the `Mockito.timeout(-1)` call does not throw an exception, the test will proceed to the next line, which is `Assert.fail(""It is forbidden to invoke Mockito.timeout() with negative value."");`. This line will cause the test to fail, indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.
- The test is wrapped in a try-catch block. If the `Mockito.timeout(-1)` call correctly throws a `FriendlyReminderException`, the catch block will be executed.
- Inside the catch block, `Assert.assertTrue(true);` is called, which effectively marks the test as passed, confirming that the exception was thrown as expected.

The test utility method `Mockito.timeout()` is expected to check the duration value and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative. However, since the test is failing, it suggests that `Mockito.timeout()` is not currently handling negative values as expected.

2) Explanation for test two:

The test method `should_throw_exception_when_duration_is_negative_for_after_method` is similar in structure and purpose to the first test. It is designed to verify that the `Mockito.after()` method throws an exception when called with a negative duration value. The test logic is as follows:

- The test attempts to call `Mockito.after(-1)`, expecting this call to be invalid due to the negative duration.
- If `Mockito.after(-1)` does not throw an exception, the test will reach `Assert.fail(""It is forbidden to invoke Mockito.after() with negative value."");`, causing the test to fail and indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.
- The test is enclosed in a try-catch block. If `Mockito.after(-1)` correctly throws a `FriendlyReminderException`, the catch block will execute.
- Within the catch block, `Assert.assertTrue(true);` is executed, marking the test as passed, confirming that the exception was thrown as expected.

The test utility method `Mockito.after()` should be responsible for checking the duration value and throwing a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative. The failure of this test suggests that `Mockito.after()` is not currently handling negative values as expected.

In both tests, the failure indicates that the `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` methods are not correctly implementing the logic to throw a `FriendlyReminderException` when a negative duration is provided. This needs to be addressed in the implementation of these methods.

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **Test Purpose**:
   - Both tests are designed to verify that a specific method (`Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()`) throws an exception when called with a negative duration value.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Both methods are expected to throw a `FriendlyReminderException` when invoked with a negative duration.

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Both tests use a try-catch block to catch the expected `FriendlyReminderException`.
   - If the exception is not thrown, the test fails with an `Assert.fail()` call.

4. **Failure Point**:
   - Both tests fail at the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.

5. **Stack Trace**:
   - The stack trace for both tests shows an `AssertionFailedError` at the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the exception was not thrown.

### Possible Defect in Production Code:

Given the common patterns and the failure points, the likely defect in the production code is:

- **Lack of Validation for Negative Durations**:
  - The methods `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` are not currently implementing the necessary validation to check for negative duration values.
  - These methods should include logic to verify the duration parameter and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative.

### Recommendation:

To address the defect, the production code for both `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` should be reviewed and updated to include validation logic. Specifically, the methods should:

1. Check if the duration parameter is negative.
2. If negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message indicating that negative durations are not allowed.

By implementing this validation, the methods will correctly handle negative duration values, and the tests should pass as expected."

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **Test Purpose**:
   - Both tests are designed to verify that a specific method (`Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()`) throws an exception when called with a negative duration value.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Both methods are expected to throw a `FriendlyReminderException` when invoked with a negative duration.

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Both tests use a try-catch block to catch the expected `FriendlyReminderException`.
   - If the exception is not thrown, the test fails with an `Assert.fail()` call.

4. **Failure Point**:
   - Both tests fail at the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.

5. **Stack Trace**:
   - The stack trace for both tests shows an `AssertionFailedError` at the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the exception was not thrown.

### Possible Defect in Production Code:

Given the common patterns and the failure points, the likely defect in the production code is:

- **Lack of Validation for Negative Durations**:
  - The methods `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` are not currently implementing the necessary validation to check for negative duration values.
  - These methods should include logic to verify the duration parameter and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative.

### Recommendation:

1. Check if the duration parameter is negative.
2. If negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message indicating that negative durations are not allowed.

Sometimes it's just better to refactor the code to allow <code>equals()</code> matching or even implement <code>equals()</code> method to help out with testing. <p> Also, read <a href=""#15"">section 15</a> or javadoc for {@link ArgumentCaptor} class. {@link ArgumentCaptor} is a special implementation of an argument matcher that captures argument values for further assertions. <p> <b>Warning on argument matchers:</b> <p> If you are using argument matchers, <b>all arguments</b> have to be provided by matchers. <p> E.g: (example shows verification but the same applies to stubbing):  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>eq(""third argument"")</b>); above is correct - eq() is also an argument matcher  verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>""third argument""</b>); above is incorrect - exception will be thrown because third argument is given without an argument matcher. </code></pre>  <p> Matcher methods like <code>anyObject()</code>, <code>eq()</code> <b>do not</b> return matchers.

The main reason is improved readability and consistency with the family of <code>doAnswer()</code> methods. <p> Use <code>doThrow()</code> when you want to stub a void method with an exception: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> doThrow(new RuntimeException()).when(mockedList).clear();  following throws RuntimeException: mockedList.clear(); </code></pre>  <p> You can use <code>doThrow()</code>, <code>doAnswer()</code>, <code>doNothing()</code>, <code>doReturn()</code> and <code>doCallRealMethod()</code> in place of the corresponding call with <code>when()</code>, for any method. It is necessary when you <ul> <li>stub void methods</li> <li>stub methods on spy objects (see below)</li> <li>stub the same method more than once, to change the behaviour of a mock in the middle of a test.</li> </ul> but you may prefer to use these methods in place of the alternative with <code>when()</code>, for all of your stubbing calls. <p> Read more about these methods: <p> {@link Mockito#doReturn(Object)} <p> {@link Mockito#doThrow(Throwable)} <p> {@link Mockito#doThrow(Class)} <p> {@link Mockito#doAnswer(Answer)} <p> {@link Mockito#doNothing()} <p> {@link Mockito#doCallRealMethod()}     <h3 id=""13"">13. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#spy"">Spying on real objects</a></h3>  You can create spies of real objects. When you use the spy then the <b>real</b> methods are called (unless a method was stubbed). <p> Real spies should be used <b>carefully and occasionally</b>, for example when dealing with legacy code.  <p> Spying on real objects can be associated with ""partial mocking"" concept. <b>Before the release 1.8</b>, Mockito spies were not real partial mocks. The reason was we thought partial mock is a code smell. At some point we found legitimate use cases for partial mocks (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code, the full article is <a href= ""http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring"" >here</a>) <p>  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List list = new LinkedList(); List spy = spy(list);  optionally, you can stub out some methods: when(spy.size()).thenReturn(100);  using the spy calls <b>*real*</b> methods spy.add(""one""); spy.add(""two"");  prints ""one"" - the first element of a list System.out.println(spy.get(0));  size() method was stubbed - 100 is printed System.out.println(spy.size());  optionally, you can verify verify(spy).add(""one""); verify(spy).add(""two""); </code></pre>  <h4>Important gotcha on spying real objects!</h4> <ol> <li>Sometimes it's impossible or impractical to use {@link Mockito#when(Object)} for stubbing spies. Therefore when using spies please consider <code>doReturn</code>|<code>Answer</code>|<code>Throw()</code> family of methods for stubbing. Example:  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List list = new LinkedList(); List spy = spy(list);  Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty) when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn(""foo"");  You have to use doReturn() for stubbing doReturn(""foo"").when(spy).get(0); </code></pre> </li>  <li>Mockito <b>*does not*</b> delegate calls to the passed real instance, instead it actually creates a copy of it. So if you keep the real instance and interact with it, don't expect the spied to be aware of those interaction and their effect on real instance state. The corollary is that when an <b>*unstubbed*</b> method is called <b>*on the spy*</b> but <b>*not on the real instance*</b>, you won't see any effects on the real instance. </li>  <li>Watch out for final methods. Mockito doesn't mock final methods so the bottom line is: when you spy on real objects + you try to stub a final method = trouble. Also you won't be able to verify those method as well. </li> </ol>     <h3 id=""14"">14. Changing <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#defaultreturn"">default return values of unstubbed invocations</a> (Since 1.7)</h3>  You can create a mock with specified strategy for its return values. It's quite advanced feature and typically you don't need it to write decent tests. However, it can be helpful for working with <b>legacy systems</b>. <p> It is the default answer so it will be used <b>only when you don't</b> stub the method call.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> Foo mock = mock(Foo.class, Mockito.RETURNS_SMART_NULLS); Foo mockTwo = mock(Foo.class, new YourOwnAnswer()); </code></pre>  <p> Read more about this interesting implementation of <i>Answer</i>: {@link Mockito#RETURNS_SMART_NULLS}     <h3 id=""15"">15. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#captors"">Capturing arguments</a> for further assertions (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Mockito verifies argument values in natural java style: by using an <code>equals()</code> method. This is also the recommended way of matching arguments because it makes tests clean & simple. In some situations though, it is helpful to assert on certain arguments after the actual verification. For example: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> ArgumentCaptor&lt;Person&gt; argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Person.class); verify(mock).doSomething(argument.capture()); assertEquals(""John"", argument.getValue().getName()); </code></pre>  <b>Warning:</b> it is recommended to use ArgumentCaptor with verification <b>but not</b> with stubbing. Using ArgumentCaptor with stubbing may decrease test readability because captor is created outside of assert (aka verify or 'then') block. Also it may reduce defect localization because if stubbed method was not called then no argument is captured. <p> In a way ArgumentCaptor is related to custom argument matchers (see javadoc for {@link ArgumentMatcher} class). Both techniques can be used for making sure certain arguments where passed to mocks. However, ArgumentCaptor may be a better fit if: <ul> <li>custom argument matcher is not likely to be reused</li> <li>you just need it to assert on argument values to complete verification</li> </ul> Custom argument matchers via {@link ArgumentMatcher} are usually better for stubbing.     <h3 id=""16"">16. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#partial_mocks"">Real partial mocks</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Finally, after many internal debates & discussions on the mailing list, partial mock support was added to Mockito. Previously we considered partial mocks as code smells. However, we found a legitimate use case for partial mocks - more reading: <a href=""http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring"">here</a> <p> <b>Before release 1.8</b> <code>spy()</code> was not producing real partial mocks and it was confusing for some users. Read more about spying: <a href=""#13"">here</a> or in javadoc for {@link Mockito#spy(Object)} method. <p> <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> you can create partial mock with spy() method: List list = spy(new LinkedList());  you can enable partial mock capabilities selectively on mocks: Foo mock = mock(Foo.class); Be sure the real implementation is 'safe'. If real implementation throws exceptions or depends on specific state of the object then you're in trouble. when(mock.someMethod()).thenCallRealMethod(); </code></pre>  As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>: Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects. How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't... Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object. In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application. <p> However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.) However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.     <h3 id=""17"">17. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#resetting_mocks"">Resetting mocks</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it could be a sign of poor tests. Normally, you don't need to reset your mocks, just create new mocks for each test method. <p> Instead of <code>reset()</code> please consider writing simple, small and focused test methods over lengthy, over-specified tests. <b>First potential code smell is <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method.</b> This probably means you're testing too much. Follow the whisper of your test methods: ""Please keep us small & focused on single behavior"". There are several threads about it on mockito mailing list. <p> The only reason we added <code>reset()</code> method is to make it possible to work with container-injected mocks. See issue 55 (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=55"">here</a>) or FAQ (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ"">here</a>). <p> <b>Don't harm yourself.</b> <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method is a code smell (you're probably testing too much). <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List mock = mock(List.class); when(mock.size()).thenReturn(10); mock.add(1);  reset(mock); at this point the mock forgot any interactions & stubbing </code></pre>     <h3 id=""18"">18. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#framework_validation"">Troubleshooting & validating framework usage</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  First of all, in case of any trouble, I encourage you to read the Mockito FAQ: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ"">http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ</a> <p> In case of questions you may also post to mockito mailing list: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/mockito"">http://groups.google.com/group/mockito</a> <p> Next, you should know that Mockito validates if you use it correctly <b>all the time</b>. However, there's a gotcha so please read the javadoc for {@link Mockito#validateMockitoUsage()}     <h3 id=""19"">19. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#bdd_mockito"">Aliases for behavior driven development</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Behavior Driven Development style of writing tests uses <b>//given //when //then</b> comments as fundamental parts of your test methods. This is exactly how we write our tests and we warmly encourage you to do so! <p> Start learning about BDD here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development</a> <p> The problem is that current stubbing api with canonical role of <b>when</b> word does not integrate nicely with <b>//given //when //then</b> comments. It's because stubbing belongs to <b>given</b> component of the test and not to the <b>when</b> component of the test. Hence {@link BDDMockito} class introduces an alias so that you stub method calls with {@link BDDMockito#given(Object)} method. Now it really nicely integrates with the <b>given</b> component of a BDD style test! <p> Here is how the test might look like: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;  Seller seller = mock(Seller.class); Shop shop = new Shop(seller);  public void shouldBuyBread() throws Exception { given given(seller.askForBread()).willReturn(new Bread());  when Goods goods = shop.buyBread();  then assertThat(goods, containBread()); } </code></pre>     <h3 id=""20"">20. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#serializable_mocks"">Serializable mocks</a> (Since 1.8.1)</h3>  Mocks can be made serializable. With this feature you can use a mock in a place that requires dependencies to be serializable. <p> WARNING: This should be rarely used in unit testing. <p> The behaviour was implemented for a specific use case of a BDD spec that had an unreliable external dependency.  This was in a web environment and the objects from the external dependency were being serialized to pass between layers. <p> To create serializable mock use {@link MockSettings#serializable()}: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List serializableMock = mock(List.class, withSettings().serializable()); </code></pre> <p> The mock can be serialized assuming all the normal <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html'> serialization requirements</a> are met by the class. <p> Making a real object spy serializable is a bit more effort as the spy(...) method does not have an overloaded version which accepts MockSettings. No worries, you will hardly ever use it.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List&lt;Object&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); List&lt;Object&gt; spy = mock(ArrayList.class, withSettings() .spiedInstance(list) .defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS) .serializable()); </code></pre>     <h3 id=""21"">21. New annotations: <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#captor_annotation""><code>&#064;Captor</code></a>, <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#spy_annotation""><code>&#064;Spy</code></a>, <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#injectmocks_annotation""><code>&#064;InjectMocks</code></a> (Since 1.8.3)</h3>  <p> Release 1.8.3 brings new annotations that may be helpful on occasion:  <ul> <li>&#064;{@link Captor} simplifies creation of {@link ArgumentCaptor} - useful when the argument to capture is a nasty generic class and you want to avoid compiler warnings <li>&#064;{@link Spy} - you can use it instead {@link Mockito#spy(Object)}. <li>&#064;{@link InjectMocks} - injects mock or spy fields into tested object automatically. </ul>  <p> Note that &#064;{@link InjectMocks} can also be used in combination with the &#064;{@link Spy} annotation, it means that Mockito will inject mocks into the partial mock under test. This complexity is another good reason why you should only use partial mocks as a last resort. See point 16 about partial mocks.  <p> All new annotations are <b>*only*</b> processed on {@link MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)}. Just like for &#064;{@link Mock} annotation you can use the built-in runner: {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} or rule: {@link MockitoRule}. <p>     <h3 id=""22"">22. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#verification_timeout"">Verification with timeout</a> (Since 1.8.5)</h3> <p> Allows verifying with timeout. It causes a verify to wait for a specified period of time for a desired interaction rather than fails immediately if had not already happened. May be useful for testing in concurrent conditions. <p> It feels this feature should be used rarely - figure out a better way of testing your multi-threaded system. <p> Not yet implemented to work with InOrder verification. <p> Examples: <p> <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> passes when someMethod() is called within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100)).someMethod(); above is an alias to: verify(mock, timeout(100).times(1)).someMethod();  passes when someMethod() is called <b>*exactly*</b> 2 times within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100).times(2)).someMethod();  passes when someMethod() is called <b>*at least*</b> 2 times within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100).atLeast(2)).someMethod();  verifies someMethod() within given time span using given verification mode useful only if you have your own custom verification modes. verify(mock, new Timeout(100, yourOwnVerificationMode)).someMethod(); </code></pre>     <h3 id=""23"">23. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#automatic_instantiation"">Automatic instantiation of <code>&#064;Spies</code>, <code>&#064;InjectMocks</code></a> and <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#constructor_injection"">constructor injection goodness</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3>  <p> Mockito will now try to instantiate &#064;{@link Spy} and will instantiate &#064;{@link InjectMocks} fields using <b>constructor</b> injection, <b>setter</b> injection, or <b>field</b> injection. <p> To take advantage of this feature you need to use {@link MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)}, {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} or {@link MockitoRule}. <p> Read more about available tricks and the rules of injection in the javadoc for {@link InjectMocks} <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> instead: &#064;Spy BeerDrinker drinker = new BeerDrinker(); you can write: &#064;Spy BeerDrinker drinker;  same applies to &#064;InjectMocks annotation: &#064;InjectMocks LocalPub; </code></pre>     <h3 id=""24"">24. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#one_liner_stub"">One-liner stubs</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3> <p> Mockito will now allow you to create mocks when stubbing. Basically, it allows to create a stub in one line of code. This can be helpful to keep test code clean. For example, some boring stub can be created & stubbed at field initialization in a test: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> public class CarTest { Car boringStubbedCar = when(mock(Car.class).shiftGear()).thenThrow(EngineNotStarted.class).getMock();  &#064;Test public void should... {} </code></pre>     <h3 id=""25"">25. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#ignore_stubs_verification"">Verification ignoring stubs</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3> <p> Mockito will now allow to ignore stubbing for the sake of verification. Sometimes useful when coupled with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> or verification <code>inOrder()</code>. Helps avoiding redundant verification of stubbed calls - typically we're not interested in verifying stubs. <p> <b>Warning</b>, <code>ignoreStubs()</code> might lead to overuse of verifyNoMoreInteractions(ignoreStubs(...)); Bear in mind that Mockito does not recommend bombarding every test with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> for the reasons outlined in javadoc for {@link Mockito#verifyNoMoreInteractions(Object...)} <p>Some examples: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> verify(mock).foo(); verify(mockTwo).bar();  ignores all stubbed methods: verifyNoMoreInvocations(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo));  creates InOrder that will ignore stubbed InOrder inOrder = inOrder(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo)); inOrder.verify(mock).foo(); inOrder.verify(mockTwo).bar(); inOrder.verifyNoMoreInteractions(); </code></pre> <p> Advanced examples and more details can be found in javadoc for {@link Mockito#ignoreStubs(Object...)}     <h3 id=""26"">26. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#mocking_details"">Mocking details</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3> <p> To identify whether a particular object is a mock or a spy: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> Mockito.mockingDetails(someObject).isMock(); Mockito.mockingDetails(someObject).isSpy(); </code></pre> Both the {@link MockingDetails#isMock} and {@link MockingDetails#isSpy()} methods return <code>boolean</code>. As a spy is just a different kind of mock, <code>isMock()</code> returns true if the object is a spy. In future Mockito versions MockingDetails may grow and provide other useful information about the mock, e.g. invocations, stubbing info, etc.     <h3 id=""27"">27. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#delegating_call_to_real_instance"">Delegate calls to real instance</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3>  <p>Useful for spies or partial mocks of objects <strong>that are difficult to mock or spy</strong> using the usual spy API. Since Mockito 1.10.11, the delegate may or may not be of the same type as the mock. If the type is different, a matching method needs to be found on delegate type otherwise an exception is thrown.  Possible use cases for this feature: <ul> <li>Final classes but with an interface</li> <li>Already custom proxied object</li> <li>Special objects with a finalize method, i.e. to avoid executing it 2 times</li> </ul>  <p>The difference with the regular spy: <ul> <li> The regular spy ({@link #spy(Object)}) contains <strong>all</strong> state from the spied instance and the methods are invoked on the spy. The spied instance is only used at mock creation to copy the state from. If you call a method on a regular spy and it internally calls other methods on this spy, those calls are remembered for verifications, and they can be effectively stubbed. </li> <li> The mock that delegates simply delegates all methods to the delegate. The delegate is used all the time as methods are delegated onto it. If you call a method on a mock that delegates and it internally calls other methods on this mock, those calls are <strong>not</strong> remembered for verifications, stubbing does not have effect on them, too. Mock that delegates is less powerful than the regular spy but it is useful when the regular spy cannot be created. </li> </ul>  <p> See more information in docs for {@link AdditionalAnswers#delegatesTo(Object)}.     <h3 id=""28"">28. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#mock_maker_plugin""><code>MockMaker</code> API</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3> <p>Driven by requirements and patches from Google Android guys Mockito now offers an extension point that allows replacing the proxy generation engine. By default, Mockito uses cglib to create dynamic proxies. <p>The extension point is for advanced users that want to extend Mockito. For example, it is now possible to use Mockito for Android testing with a help of dexmaker. <p>For more details, motivations and examples please refer to the docs for {@link org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker}.     <h3 id=""29"">29. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#BDD_behavior_verification"">(new) BDD style verification</a> (Since 1.10.0)</h3>  Enables Behavior Driven Development (BDD) style verification by starting verification with the BDD <b>then</b> keyword.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> then(person).should(times(2)).ride(bike); </code></pre>  For more information and an example see {@link BDDMockito#then(Object)}}  <h3 id=""30"">30. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#spying_abstract_classes"">(new) Spying or mocking abstract classes (Since 1.10.12)</a></h3>  It is now possible to conveniently spy on abstract classes. Note that overusing spies hints at code design smells (see {@link #spy(Object)}). <p> Previously, spying was only possible on instances of objects. New API makes it possible to use constructor when creating an instance of the mock. This is particularly useful for mocking abstract classes because the user is no longer required to provide an instance of the abstract class. At the moment, only parameter-less constructor is supported, let us know if it is not enough.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> convenience API, new overloaded spy() method: SomeAbstract spy = spy(SomeAbstract.class);  Robust API, via settings builder: OtherAbstract spy = mock(OtherAbstract.class, withSettings() .useConstructor().defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS));  Mocking a non-static inner abstract class: InnerAbstract spy = mock(InnerAbstract.class, withSettings() .useConstructor().outerInstance(outerInstance).defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS)); </code></pre>  For more information please see {@link MockSettings#useConstructor()}.

The natural matching style using <code>equals()</code> with occasional <code>anyX()</code> matchers tend to give clean & simple tests. Sometimes it's just better to refactor the code to allow <code>equals()</code> matching or even implement <code>equals()</code> method to help out with testing. <p> Also, read <a href=""#15"">section 15</a> or javadoc for {@link ArgumentCaptor} class. {@link ArgumentCaptor} is a special implementation of an argument matcher that captures argument values for further assertions. <p> <b>Warning on argument matchers:</b> <p> If you are using argument matchers, <b>all arguments</b> have to be provided by matchers. <p> E.g: (example shows verification but the same applies to stubbing):  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>eq(""third argument"")</b>); above is correct - eq() is also an argument matcher  verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>""third argument""</b>); above is incorrect - exception will be thrown because third argument is given without an argument matcher. </code></pre>  <p> Matcher methods like <code>anyObject()</code>, <code>eq()</code> <b>do not</b> return matchers. Internally, they record a matcher on a stack and return a dummy value (usually null). This implementation is due static type safety imposed by java compiler.

Typical use case could be mocking iterators. Original version of Mockito did not have this feature to promote simple mocking. For example, instead of iterators one could use {@link Iterable} or simply collections. Those offer natural ways of stubbing (e.g. using real collections). In rare scenarios stubbing consecutive calls could be useful, though: <p>  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> when(mock.someMethod(""some arg"")) .thenThrow(new RuntimeException()) .thenReturn(""foo"");  First call: throws runtime exception: mock.someMethod(""some arg"");  Second call: prints ""foo"" System.out.println(mock.someMethod(""some arg""));  Any consecutive call: prints ""foo"" as well (last stubbing wins).

We recommend using simple stubbing with <code>thenReturn()</code> or <code>thenThrow()</code> only. Those two should be <b>just enough</b> to test/test-drive any clean & simple code.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> when(mock.someMethod(anyString())).thenAnswer(new Answer() { Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) { Object[] args = invocation.getArguments(); Object mock = invocation.getMock(); return ""called with arguments: "" + args; } });  Following prints ""called with arguments: foo"" System.out.println(mock.someMethod(""foo"")); </code></pre>     <h3 id=""12"">12. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#do_family_methods_stubs""><code>doReturn()</code>|<code>doThrow()</code>| <code>doAnswer()</code>|<code>doNothing()</code>|<code>doCallRealMethod()</code> family of methods</a></h3>  Stubbing voids requires different approach from {@link Mockito#when(Object)} because the compiler does not like void methods inside brackets... <p> {@link Mockito#doThrow(Throwable)} replaces the {@link Mockito#stubVoid(Object)} method for stubbing voids. The main reason is improved readability and consistency with the family of <code>doAnswer()</code> methods. <p> Use <code>doThrow()</code> when you want to stub a void method with an exception: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> doThrow(new RuntimeException()).when(mockedList).clear();  following throws RuntimeException: mockedList.clear(); </code></pre>  <p> You can use <code>doThrow()</code>, <code>doAnswer()</code>, <code>doNothing()</code>, <code>doReturn()</code> and <code>doCallRealMethod()</code> in place of the corresponding call with <code>when()</code>, for any method. It is necessary when you <ul> <li>stub void methods</li> <li>stub methods on spy objects (see below)</li> <li>stub the same method more than once, to change the behaviour of a mock in the middle of a test.</li> </ul> but you may prefer to use these methods in place of the alternative with <code>when()</code>, for all of your stubbing calls. <p> Read more about these methods: <p> {@link Mockito#doReturn(Object)} <p> {@link Mockito#doThrow(Throwable)} <p> {@link Mockito#doThrow(Class)} <p> {@link Mockito#doAnswer(Answer)} <p> {@link Mockito#doNothing()} <p> {@link Mockito#doCallRealMethod()}     <h3 id=""13"">13. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#spy"">Spying on real objects</a></h3>  You can create spies of real objects. When you use the spy then the <b>real</b> methods are called (unless a method was stubbed). <p> Real spies should be used <b>carefully and occasionally</b>, for example when dealing with legacy code.  <p> Spying on real objects can be associated with ""partial mocking"" concept. <b>Before the release 1.8</b>, Mockito spies were not real partial mocks. The reason was we thought partial mock is a code smell. At some point we found legitimate use cases for partial mocks (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code, the full article is <a href= ""http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring"" >here</a>) <p>  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List list = new LinkedList(); List spy = spy(list);  optionally, you can stub out some methods: when(spy.size()).thenReturn(100);  using the spy calls <b>*real*</b> methods spy.add(""one""); spy.add(""two"");  prints ""one"" - the first element of a list System.out.println(spy.get(0));  size() method was stubbed - 100 is printed System.out.println(spy.size());  optionally, you can verify verify(spy).add(""one""); verify(spy).add(""two""); </code></pre>  <h4>Important gotcha on spying real objects!</h4> <ol> <li>Sometimes it's impossible or impractical to use {@link Mockito#when(Object)} for stubbing spies. Therefore when using spies please consider <code>doReturn</code>|<code>Answer</code>|<code>Throw()</code> family of methods for stubbing. Example:  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List list = new LinkedList(); List spy = spy(list);  Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty) when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn(""foo"");  You have to use doReturn() for stubbing doReturn(""foo"").when(spy).get(0); </code></pre> </li>  <li>Mockito <b>*does not*</b> delegate calls to the passed real instance, instead it actually creates a copy of it. So if you keep the real instance and interact with it, don't expect the spied to be aware of those interaction and their effect on real instance state. The corollary is that when an <b>*unstubbed*</b> method is called <b>*on the spy*</b> but <b>*not on the real instance*</b>, you won't see any effects on the real instance. </li>  <li>Watch out for final methods. Mockito doesn't mock final methods so the bottom line is: when you spy on real objects + you try to stub a final method = trouble. Also you won't be able to verify those method as well. </li> </ol>     <h3 id=""14"">14. Changing <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#defaultreturn"">default return values of unstubbed invocations</a> (Since 1.7)</h3>  You can create a mock with specified strategy for its return values. It's quite advanced feature and typically you don't need it to write decent tests. However, it can be helpful for working with <b>legacy systems</b>. <p> It is the default answer so it will be used <b>only when you don't</b> stub the method call.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> Foo mock = mock(Foo.class, Mockito.RETURNS_SMART_NULLS); Foo mockTwo = mock(Foo.class, new YourOwnAnswer()); </code></pre>  <p> Read more about this interesting implementation of <i>Answer</i>: {@link Mockito#RETURNS_SMART_NULLS}     <h3 id=""15"">15. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#captors"">Capturing arguments</a> for further assertions (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Mockito verifies argument values in natural java style: by using an <code>equals()</code> method. This is also the recommended way of matching arguments because it makes tests clean & simple. In some situations though, it is helpful to assert on certain arguments after the actual verification. For example: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> ArgumentCaptor&lt;Person&gt; argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Person.class); verify(mock).doSomething(argument.capture()); assertEquals(""John"", argument.getValue().getName()); </code></pre>  <b>Warning:</b> it is recommended to use ArgumentCaptor with verification <b>but not</b> with stubbing. Using ArgumentCaptor with stubbing may decrease test readability because captor is created outside of assert (aka verify or 'then') block. Also it may reduce defect localization because if stubbed method was not called then no argument is captured. <p> In a way ArgumentCaptor is related to custom argument matchers (see javadoc for {@link ArgumentMatcher} class). Both techniques can be used for making sure certain arguments where passed to mocks. However, ArgumentCaptor may be a better fit if: <ul> <li>custom argument matcher is not likely to be reused</li> <li>you just need it to assert on argument values to complete verification</li> </ul> Custom argument matchers via {@link ArgumentMatcher} are usually better for stubbing.     <h3 id=""16"">16. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#partial_mocks"">Real partial mocks</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Finally, after many internal debates & discussions on the mailing list, partial mock support was added to Mockito. Previously we considered partial mocks as code smells. However, we found a legitimate use case for partial mocks - more reading: <a href=""http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring"">here</a> <p> <b>Before release 1.8</b> <code>spy()</code> was not producing real partial mocks and it was confusing for some users. Read more about spying: <a href=""#13"">here</a> or in javadoc for {@link Mockito#spy(Object)} method. <p> <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> you can create partial mock with spy() method: List list = spy(new LinkedList());  you can enable partial mock capabilities selectively on mocks: Foo mock = mock(Foo.class); Be sure the real implementation is 'safe'. If real implementation throws exceptions or depends on specific state of the object then you're in trouble. when(mock.someMethod()).thenCallRealMethod(); </code></pre>  As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>: Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects. How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't... Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object. In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application. <p> However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.) However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.     <h3 id=""17"">17. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#resetting_mocks"">Resetting mocks</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it could be a sign of poor tests. Normally, you don't need to reset your mocks, just create new mocks for each test method. <p> Instead of <code>reset()</code> please consider writing simple, small and focused test methods over lengthy, over-specified tests. <b>First potential code smell is <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method.</b> This probably means you're testing too much. Follow the whisper of your test methods: ""Please keep us small & focused on single behavior"". There are several threads about it on mockito mailing list. <p> The only reason we added <code>reset()</code> method is to make it possible to work with container-injected mocks. See issue 55 (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=55"">here</a>) or FAQ (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ"">here</a>). <p> <b>Don't harm yourself.</b> <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method is a code smell (you're probably testing too much). <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List mock = mock(List.class); when(mock.size()).thenReturn(10); mock.add(1);  reset(mock); at this point the mock forgot any interactions & stubbing </code></pre>     <h3 id=""18"">18. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#framework_validation"">Troubleshooting & validating framework usage</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  First of all, in case of any trouble, I encourage you to read the Mockito FAQ: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ"">http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ</a> <p> In case of questions you may also post to mockito mailing list: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/mockito"">http://groups.google.com/group/mockito</a> <p> Next, you should know that Mockito validates if you use it correctly <b>all the time</b>. However, there's a gotcha so please read the javadoc for {@link Mockito#validateMockitoUsage()}     <h3 id=""19"">19. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#bdd_mockito"">Aliases for behavior driven development</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>  Behavior Driven Development style of writing tests uses <b>//given //when //then</b> comments as fundamental parts of your test methods. This is exactly how we write our tests and we warmly encourage you to do so! <p> Start learning about BDD here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development</a> <p> The problem is that current stubbing api with canonical role of <b>when</b> word does not integrate nicely with <b>//given //when //then</b> comments. It's because stubbing belongs to <b>given</b> component of the test and not to the <b>when</b> component of the test. Hence {@link BDDMockito} class introduces an alias so that you stub method calls with {@link BDDMockito#given(Object)} method. Now it really nicely integrates with the <b>given</b> component of a BDD style test! <p> Here is how the test might look like: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;  Seller seller = mock(Seller.class); Shop shop = new Shop(seller);  public void shouldBuyBread() throws Exception { given given(seller.askForBread()).willReturn(new Bread());  when Goods goods = shop.buyBread();  then assertThat(goods, containBread()); } </code></pre>     <h3 id=""20"">20. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#serializable_mocks"">Serializable mocks</a> (Since 1.8.1)</h3>  Mocks can be made serializable. With this feature you can use a mock in a place that requires dependencies to be serializable. <p> WARNING: This should be rarely used in unit testing. <p> The behaviour was implemented for a specific use case of a BDD spec that had an unreliable external dependency.  This was in a web environment and the objects from the external dependency were being serialized to pass between layers. <p> To create serializable mock use {@link MockSettings#serializable()}: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List serializableMock = mock(List.class, withSettings().serializable()); </code></pre> <p> The mock can be serialized assuming all the normal <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html'> serialization requirements</a> are met by the class. <p> Making a real object spy serializable is a bit more effort as the spy(...) method does not have an overloaded version which accepts MockSettings. No worries, you will hardly ever use it.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> List&lt;Object&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); List&lt;Object&gt; spy = mock(ArrayList.class, withSettings() .spiedInstance(list) .defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS) .serializable()); </code></pre>     <h3 id=""21"">21.

This complexity is another good reason why you should only use partial mocks as a last resort. See point 16 about partial mocks.  <p> All new annotations are <b>*only*</b> processed on {@link MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)}. Just like for &#064;{@link Mock} annotation you can use the built-in runner: {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} or rule: {@link MockitoRule}. <p>     <h3 id=""22"">22. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#verification_timeout"">Verification with timeout</a> (Since 1.8.5)</h3> <p> Allows verifying with timeout. It causes a verify to wait for a specified period of time for a desired interaction rather than fails immediately if had not already happened. May be useful for testing in concurrent conditions. <p> It feels this feature should be used rarely - figure out a better way of testing your multi-threaded system. <p> Not yet implemented to work with InOrder verification. <p> Examples: <p> <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> passes when someMethod() is called within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100)).someMethod(); above is an alias to: verify(mock, timeout(100).times(1)).someMethod();  passes when someMethod() is called <b>*exactly*</b> 2 times within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100).times(2)).someMethod();  passes when someMethod() is called <b>*at least*</b> 2 times within given time span verify(mock, timeout(100).atLeast(2)).someMethod();  verifies someMethod() within given time span using given verification mode useful only if you have your own custom verification modes. verify(mock, new Timeout(100, yourOwnVerificationMode)).someMethod(); </code></pre>     <h3 id=""23"">23. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#automatic_instantiation"">Automatic instantiation of <code>&#064;Spies</code>, <code>&#064;InjectMocks</code></a> and <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#constructor_injection"">constructor injection goodness</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3>  <p> Mockito will now try to instantiate &#064;{@link Spy} and will instantiate &#064;{@link InjectMocks} fields using <b>constructor</b> injection, <b>setter</b> injection, or <b>field</b> injection. <p> To take advantage of this feature you need to use {@link MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)}, {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} or {@link MockitoRule}. <p> Read more about available tricks and the rules of injection in the javadoc for {@link InjectMocks} <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> instead: &#064;Spy BeerDrinker drinker = new BeerDrinker(); you can write: &#064;Spy BeerDrinker drinker;  same applies to &#064;InjectMocks annotation: &#064;InjectMocks LocalPub; </code></pre>     <h3 id=""24"">24. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#one_liner_stub"">One-liner stubs</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3> <p> Mockito will now allow you to create mocks when stubbing. Basically, it allows to create a stub in one line of code. This can be helpful to keep test code clean. For example, some boring stub can be created & stubbed at field initialization in a test: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> public class CarTest { Car boringStubbedCar = when(mock(Car.class).shiftGear()).thenThrow(EngineNotStarted.class).getMock();  &#064;Test public void should... {} </code></pre>     <h3 id=""25"">25. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#ignore_stubs_verification"">Verification ignoring stubs</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3> <p> Mockito will now allow to ignore stubbing for the sake of verification. Sometimes useful when coupled with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> or verification <code>inOrder()</code>. Helps avoiding redundant verification of stubbed calls - typically we're not interested in verifying stubs. <p> <b>Warning</b>, <code>ignoreStubs()</code> might lead to overuse of verifyNoMoreInteractions(ignoreStubs(...)); Bear in mind that Mockito does not recommend bombarding every test with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> for the reasons outlined in javadoc for {@link Mockito#verifyNoMoreInteractions(Object...)} <p>Some examples: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> verify(mock).foo(); verify(mockTwo).bar();  ignores all stubbed methods: verifyNoMoreInvocations(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo));  creates InOrder that will ignore stubbed InOrder inOrder = inOrder(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo)); inOrder.verify(mock).foo(); inOrder.verify(mockTwo).bar(); inOrder.verifyNoMoreInteractions(); </code></pre> <p> Advanced examples and more details can be found in javadoc for {@link Mockito#ignoreStubs(Object...)}     <h3 id=""26"">26. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#mocking_details"">Mocking details</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3> <p> To identify whether a particular object is a mock or a spy: <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> Mockito.mockingDetails(someObject).isMock(); Mockito.mockingDetails(someObject).isSpy(); </code></pre> Both the {@link MockingDetails#isMock} and {@link MockingDetails#isSpy()} methods return <code>boolean</code>. As a spy is just a different kind of mock, <code>isMock()</code> returns true if the object is a spy. In future Mockito versions MockingDetails may grow and provide other useful information about the mock, e.g. invocations, stubbing info, etc.     <h3 id=""27"">27. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#delegating_call_to_real_instance"">Delegate calls to real instance</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3>  <p>Useful for spies or partial mocks of objects <strong>that are difficult to mock or spy</strong> using the usual spy API. Since Mockito 1.10.11, the delegate may or may not be of the same type as the mock. If the type is different, a matching method needs to be found on delegate type otherwise an exception is thrown.  Possible use cases for this feature: <ul> <li>Final classes but with an interface</li> <li>Already custom proxied object</li> <li>Special objects with a finalize method, i.e. to avoid executing it 2 times</li> </ul>  <p>The difference with the regular spy: <ul> <li> The regular spy ({@link #spy(Object)}) contains <strong>all</strong> state from the spied instance and the methods are invoked on the spy. The spied instance is only used at mock creation to copy the state from. If you call a method on a regular spy and it internally calls other methods on this spy, those calls are remembered for verifications, and they can be effectively stubbed. </li> <li> The mock that delegates simply delegates all methods to the delegate. The delegate is used all the time as methods are delegated onto it. If you call a method on a mock that delegates and it internally calls other methods on this mock, those calls are <strong>not</strong> remembered for verifications, stubbing does not have effect on them, too. Mock that delegates is less powerful than the regular spy but it is useful when the regular spy cannot be created. </li> </ul>  <p> See more information in docs for {@link AdditionalAnswers#delegatesTo(Object)}.     <h3 id=""28"">28. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#mock_maker_plugin""><code>MockMaker</code> API</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3> <p>Driven by requirements and patches from Google Android guys Mockito now offers an extension point that allows replacing the proxy generation engine. By default, Mockito uses cglib to create dynamic proxies. <p>The extension point is for advanced users that want to extend Mockito. For example, it is now possible to use Mockito for Android testing with a help of dexmaker. <p>For more details, motivations and examples please refer to the docs for {@link org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker}.     <h3 id=""29"">29. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#BDD_behavior_verification"">(new) BDD style verification</a> (Since 1.10.0)</h3>  Enables Behavior Driven Development (BDD) style verification by starting verification with the BDD <b>then</b> keyword.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> then(person).should(times(2)).ride(bike); </code></pre>  For more information and an example see {@link BDDMockito#then(Object)}}  <h3 id=""30"">30. <a class=""meaningful_link"" href=""#spying_abstract_classes"">(new) Spying or mocking abstract classes (Since 1.10.12)</a></h3>  It is now possible to conveniently spy on abstract classes. Note that overusing spies hints at code design smells (see {@link #spy(Object)}). <p> Previously, spying was only possible on instances of objects. New API makes it possible to use constructor when creating an instance of the mock. This is particularly useful for mocking abstract classes because the user is no longer required to provide an instance of the abstract class. At the moment, only parameter-less constructor is supported, let us know if it is not enough.  <pre class=""code""><code class=""java""> convenience API, new overloaded spy() method: SomeAbstract spy = spy(SomeAbstract.class);  Robust API, via settings builder: OtherAbstract spy = mock(OtherAbstract.class, withSettings() .useConstructor().defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS));  Mocking a non-static inner abstract class: InnerAbstract spy = mock(InnerAbstract.class, withSettings() .useConstructor().outerInstance(outerInstance).defaultAnswer(CALLS_REAL_METHODS)); </code></pre>  For more information please see {@link MockSettings#useConstructor()}.

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **Test Purpose**:
   - Both tests are designed to verify that a specific method (`Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()`) throws an exception when called with a negative duration value.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Both methods are expected to throw a `FriendlyReminderException` when invoked with a negative duration.

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Both tests use a try-catch block to catch the expected `FriendlyReminderException`.
   - If the exception is not thrown, the test fails with an `Assert.fail()` call.

4. **Failure Point**:
   - Both tests fail at the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.

5. **Stack Trace**:
   - The stack trace for both tests shows an `AssertionFailedError` at the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the exception was not thrown.

### Possible Defect in Production Code:

Given the common patterns and the failure points, the likely defect in the production code is:

- **Lack of Validation for Negative Durations**:
  - The methods `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` are not currently implementing the necessary validation to check for negative duration values.
  - These methods should include logic to verify the duration parameter and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative.

### Recommendation:

To address the defect, the production code for both `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` should be reviewed and updated to include validation logic. Specifically, the methods should:

1. Check if the duration parameter is negative.
2. If negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message indicating that negative durations are not allowed.

By implementing this validation, the methods will correctly handle negative duration values, and the tests should pass as expected."""

It causes a verify to wait for a specified period of time for a desired interaction rather than fails immediately if has not already happened. May be useful for testing in concurrent conditions. <p> This differs from {@link Mockito#after after()} in that after() will wait the full period, unless the final test result is known early (e.g. if a never() fails), whereas timeout() will stop early as soon as verification passes, producing different behaviour when used with times(2), for example, which can pass and then later fail. In that case, timeout would pass as soon as times(2) passes, whereas after would run until times(2) failed, and then fail. <p> It feels this feature should be used rarely - figure out a better way of testing your multi-threaded system <p> Not yet implemented to work with InOrder verification. <pre class="

"Day20250923.v4.Mockito-2.d4j140-gpt_4_o.txt","8661","MethodReview","test_failure_causes","""To identify the common patterns and recommend possible defects in the production code, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **Test Purpose**:
   - Both tests are designed to verify that a specific method (`Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()`) throws an exception when called with a negative duration value.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Both methods are expected to throw a `FriendlyReminderException` when invoked with a negative duration.

3. **Test Structure**:
   - Both tests use a try-catch block to catch the expected `FriendlyReminderException`.
   - If the exception is not thrown, the test fails with an `Assert.fail()` call.

4. **Failure Point**:
   - Both tests fail at the `Assert.fail()` line, indicating that the expected exception was not thrown.

5. **Stack Trace**:
   - The stack trace for both tests shows an `AssertionFailedError` at the `Assert.fail()` line, confirming that the exception was not thrown.

### Possible Defect in Production Code:

Given the common patterns and the failure points, the likely defect in the production code is:

- **Lack of Validation for Negative Durations**:
  - The methods `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` are not currently implementing the necessary validation to check for negative duration values.
  - These methods should include logic to verify the duration parameter and throw a `FriendlyReminderException` if the value is negative.

### Recommendation:

To address the defect, the production code for both `Mockito.timeout()` and `Mockito.after()` should be reviewed and updated to include validation logic. Specifically, the methods should:

1. Check if the duration parameter is negative.
2. If negative, throw a `FriendlyReminderException` with an appropriate message indicating that negative durations are not allowed.

By implementing this validation, the methods will correctly handle negative duration values, and the tests should pass as expected."""
