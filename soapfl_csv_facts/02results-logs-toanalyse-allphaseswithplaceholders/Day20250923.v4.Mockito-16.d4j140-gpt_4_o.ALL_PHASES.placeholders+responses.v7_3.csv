1) explanation for test one:

The test method `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is designed to verify that a mock object, which is configured with the `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer, can be stubbed to return a specific value. 

- The test begins by creating a mock of the `IMethods` interface using the `mock` method from the Mockito framework. The `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer is specified, which means that any method call on the mock that returns an object will itself return a mock. This is useful for deep stubbing, where you want to avoid manually creating and injecting mocks for every level of a call chain.

- The line `when(mock.objectReturningMethodNoArgs()).thenReturn(null);` attempts to stub the `objectReturningMethodNoArgs` method of the `mock` object to return `null`. This is where the error occurs. The intention here is to override the default behavior provided by `RETURNS_MOCKS` for this specific method call, so that instead of returning another mock, it returns `null`.

The failure in this test could be due to several reasons, such as:
  - The `objectReturningMethodNoArgs` method might not be correctly defined in the `IMethods` interface.
  - There might be a configuration issue with the Mockito framework or the test environment that prevents the stubbing from being applied correctly.
  - The `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer might have a conflict with the explicit stubbing, depending on the version of Mockito being used.

Since there are no utility methods provided in the test utility methods section, the explanation is focused solely on the test method itself.

### Analysis of the Test and Error

1. **Test Objective**:
   - The test `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is intended to verify that a mock object configured with `RETURNS_MOCKS` can be explicitly stubbed to return a specific value (`null` in this case) for a method call.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The error is a `MissingMethodInvocationException`, which indicates that the `when()` method did not receive a valid method call on a mock object.
   - The error message suggests that the method call might be missing or incorrectly defined, or that the method being stubbed is final, private, or one of the methods that cannot be stubbed (like `equals()` or `hashCode()`).

3. **Test Code**:
   - The test attempts to stub `mock.objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` to return `null`.

4. **Potential Causes**:
   - **Method Definition Issue**: The method `objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` might not be correctly defined in the `IMethods` interface, or it might be a method that cannot be stubbed (e.g., final or private).
   - **Mockito Configuration**: There might be a configuration issue with how `RETURNS_MOCKS` interacts with explicit stubbing. This could be a version-specific issue or a bug in the Mockito framework itself.
   - **Conflict with RETURNS_MOCKS**: The `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer might be interfering with the explicit stubbing, especially if the method is not being recognized as a valid invocation for stubbing.

### Recommendation for Possible Defect in Production Code

Based on the analysis, the possible defect in the production code could be:

- **Incorrect Method Signature or Accessibility**: Ensure that the `objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` method is correctly defined in the `IMethods` interface and is not final or private. It should be a public method that can be stubbed.

- **Mockito Framework Issue**: There might be a bug or limitation in the Mockito framework, particularly with the `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer. This could be causing the framework to not recognize the method call as a valid invocation for stubbing. Check if there are any known issues or updates related to `RETURNS_MOCKS` in the version of Mockito being used.

- **Deep Stubbing Conflict**: Investigate if there is a conflict between deep stubbing provided by `RETURNS_MOCKS` and explicit stubbing. This might require reviewing the implementation of `RETURNS_MOCKS` to ensure it correctly supports overriding with explicit stubbing.

By addressing these potential issues, the test should be able to successfully stub the method and pass as expected."

### Analysis of the Test and Error

1. **Test Objective**:
   - The test `shouldAllowStubbingMocksConfiguredWithRETURNS_MOCKS` is intended to verify that a mock object configured with `RETURNS_MOCKS` can be explicitly stubbed to return a specific value (`null` in this case) for a method call.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The error is a `MissingMethodInvocationException`, which indicates that the `when()` method did not receive a valid method call on a mock object.
   - The error message suggests that the method call might be missing or incorrectly defined, or that the method being stubbed is final, private, or one of the methods that cannot be stubbed (like `equals()` or `hashCode()`).

3. **Test Code**:
   - The test attempts to stub `mock.objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` to return `null`.

4. **Potential Causes**:
   - **Method Definition Issue**: The method `objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` might not be correctly defined in the `IMethods` interface, or it might be a method that cannot be stubbed (e.g., final or private).
   - **Mockito Configuration**: There might be a configuration issue with how `RETURNS_MOCKS` interacts with explicit stubbing. This could be a version-specific issue or a bug in the Mockito framework itself.
   - **Conflict with RETURNS_MOCKS**: The `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer might be interfering with the explicit stubbing, especially if the method is not being recognized as a valid invocation for stubbing.

### Recommendation for Possible Defect in Production Code

Based on the analysis, the possible defect in the production code could be:

- **Incorrect Method Signature or Accessibility**: Ensure that the `objectReturningMethodNoArgs()` method is correctly defined in the `IMethods` interface and is not final or private. It should be a public method that can be stubbed.

- **Mockito Framework Issue**: There might be a bug or limitation in the Mockito framework, particularly with the `RETURNS_MOCKS` answer. This could be causing the framework to not recognize the method call as a valid invocation for stubbing. Check if there are any known issues or updates related to `RETURNS_MOCKS` in the version of Mockito being used.

- **Deep Stubbing Conflict**: Investigate if there is a conflict between deep stubbing provided by `RETURNS_MOCKS` and explicit stubbing. This might require reviewing the implementation of `RETURNS_MOCKS` to ensure it correctly supports overriding with explicit stubbing.

By addressing these potential issues, the test should be able to successfully stub the method and pass as expected."""
