1) Explanation for `testRecursiveRecord`:
   - **Objective**: This test aims to verify the behavior of a `RecordType` that includes a recursive reference through a `ProxyObjectType`.
   - **Code Logic**:
     - A `ProxyObjectType` named `loop` is initialized with `NUMBER_TYPE`.
     - A `RecordType` is constructed using `RecordTypeBuilder`, adding three properties: `""loop""` with the `loop` type, `""number""` with `NUMBER_TYPE`, and `""string""` with `STRING_TYPE`.
     - The first `assertEquals` checks if the `toString()` method of the `record` returns the expected string representation: `""{loop: number, number: number, string: string}""`.
     - The `loop` type is then set to reference the `record` itself, creating a recursive structure.
     - The second `assertEquals` checks if the `toString()` method now returns a string with the recursive part represented as `{...}`: `""{loop: {...}, number: number, string: string}""`.
     - The third `assertEquals` checks the `toAnnotationString()` method, expecting it to handle the recursive reference by outputting `""{loop: ?, number: number, string: string}""`. The error here suggests that the actual output does not match this expectation, indicating a potential issue in how `toAnnotationString()` handles recursive types.
     - Finally, `Asserts.assertEquivalenceOperations(record, loop)` is called to ensure that equivalence operations between `record` and `loop` are correctly implemented, though the details of this utility method are not provided.

2) Explanation for `testLongToString`:
   - **Objective**: This test is designed to verify the string representation of a `RecordType` with multiple properties, ensuring it handles long records correctly.
   - **Code Logic**:
     - A `RecordType` is constructed with six properties, each named `""a1""` to `""a6""`, all of type `NUMBER_TYPE`.
     - The first `assertEquals` checks if the `toString()` method of the `record` returns a truncated string representation: `""{a1: number, a2: number, a3: number, a4: number, ...}""`. The error here suggests that the actual output does not match this expected truncated format, indicating a potential issue in how `toString()` handles long records.
     - The second `assertEquals` checks the `toAnnotationString()` method, expecting it to return the full string representation of all properties: `""{a1: number, a2: number, a3: number, a4: number, a5: number, a6: number}""`. The error here suggests a mismatch between the expected and actual output, indicating a potential issue in the method's implementation.
   - **Utility Methods**: The test does not explicitly call any utility methods, but it relies on the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods of the `RecordType` class, which are expected to provide accurate string representations of the type.

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **String Representation Issues**:
   - Both tests are failing due to discrepancies in the expected and actual string representations of `RecordType` objects.
   - In `testRecursiveRecord`, the issue is with the `toAnnotationString()` method not handling recursive references correctly.
   - In `testLongToString`, the issue is with both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods not providing the expected truncated or full string representations.

2. **Handling of Recursive and Long Records**:
   - The `testRecursiveRecord` failure suggests a problem with how recursive types are represented, particularly in the `toAnnotationString()` method.
   - The `testLongToString` failure indicates a problem with how long records are represented, especially in terms of truncation in the `toString()` method and completeness in the `toAnnotationString()` method.

3. **Method Consistency**:
   - Both tests rely on the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods to provide accurate and expected string outputs. The failures suggest inconsistencies or incorrect logic in these methods when dealing with complex or large data structures.

### Recommended Possible Defect in Production Code:

Based on the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the implementation of the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods in the `RecordType` class. Here are the specific areas to investigate:

1. **Recursive Type Handling**:
   - The `toAnnotationString()` method may not be correctly identifying and representing recursive references. It should detect recursive structures and replace them with a placeholder (e.g., `{...}` or `?`) to prevent infinite loops or incorrect representations.

2. **Truncation Logic for Long Records**:
   - The `toString()` method may not be correctly implementing the truncation logic for long records. It should truncate the output after a certain number of properties and append an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that not all properties are shown.

3. **Consistency Between Methods**:
   - Ensure that both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods are consistent in their logic and output format, especially when handling complex types like recursive or long records.

By addressing these potential defects, the string representation methods should correctly handle both recursive and long records, leading to the successful passing of the tests."

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **String Representation Issues**:
   - Both tests are failing due to discrepancies in the expected and actual string representations of `RecordType` objects.
   - In `testRecursiveRecord`, the issue is with the `toAnnotationString()` method not handling recursive references correctly.
   - In `testLongToString`, the issue is with both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods not providing the expected truncated or full string representations.

2. **Handling of Recursive and Long Records**:
   - The `testRecursiveRecord` failure suggests a problem with how recursive types are represented, particularly in the `toAnnotationString()` method.
   - The `testLongToString` failure indicates a problem with how long records are represented, especially in terms of truncation in the `toString()` method and completeness in the `toAnnotationString()` method.

3. **Method Consistency**:
   - Both tests rely on the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods to provide accurate and expected string outputs. The failures suggest inconsistencies or incorrect logic in these methods when dealing with complex or large data structures.

### Recommended Possible Defect in Production Code:

Based on the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the implementation of the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods in the `RecordType` class. Here are the specific areas to investigate:

1. **Recursive Type Handling**:
   - The `toAnnotationString()` method may not be correctly identifying and representing recursive references. It should detect recursive structures and replace them with a placeholder (e.g., `{...}` or `?`) to prevent infinite loops or incorrect representations.

2. **Truncation Logic for Long Records**:
   - The `toString()` method may not be correctly implementing the truncation logic for long records. It should truncate the output after a certain number of properties and append an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that not all properties are shown.

3. **Consistency Between Methods**:
   - Ensure that both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods are consistent in their logic and output format, especially when handling complex types like recursive or long records.

By addressing these potential defects, the string representation methods should correctly handle both recursive and long records, leading to the successful passing of the tests."""

### Common Patterns and Similarities:

1. **String Representation Issues**:
   - Both tests are failing due to discrepancies in the expected and actual string representations of `RecordType` objects.
   - In `testRecursiveRecord`, the issue is with the `toAnnotationString()` method not handling recursive references correctly.
   - In `testLongToString`, the issue is with both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods not providing the expected truncated or full string representations.

2. **Handling of Recursive and Long Records**:
   - The `testRecursiveRecord` failure suggests a problem with how recursive types are represented, particularly in the `toAnnotationString()` method.
   - The `testLongToString` failure indicates a problem with how long records are represented, especially in terms of truncation in the `toString()` method and completeness in the `toAnnotationString()` method.

3. **Method Consistency**:
   - Both tests rely on the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods to provide accurate and expected string outputs. The failures suggest inconsistencies or incorrect logic in these methods when dealing with complex or large data structures.

### Recommended Possible Defect in Production Code:

Based on the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the implementation of the `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods in the `RecordType` class. Here are the specific areas to investigate:

1. **Recursive Type Handling**:
   - The `toAnnotationString()` method may not be correctly identifying and representing recursive references. It should detect recursive structures and replace them with a placeholder (e.g., `{...}` or `?`) to prevent infinite loops or incorrect representations.

2. **Truncation Logic for Long Records**:
   - The `toString()` method may not be correctly implementing the truncation logic for long records. It should truncate the output after a certain number of properties and append an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate that not all properties are shown.

3. **Consistency Between Methods**:
   - Ensure that both `toString()` and `toAnnotationString()` methods are consistent in their logic and output format, especially when handling complex types like recursive or long records.

By addressing these potential defects, the string representation methods should correctly handle both recursive and long records, leading to the successful passing of the tests."""
