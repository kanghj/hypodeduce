1) Explanation for the test ""should_serialize_and_deserialize_mock_created_by_deep_stubs"":

- **Objective**: This test aims to verify that a mock object created with deep stubs and marked as serializable can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining its behavior.

- **Setup**:
  - A mock of `SampleClass` is created using Mockito's `mock` method. The mock is configured with `withSettings().defaultAnswer(Mockito.RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS).serializable()`. This means:
    - `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS`: Allows chained method calls on the mock to return further mocks, enabling deep stubbing.
    - `serializable()`: Marks the mock as serializable, which is crucial for the serialization test.
  - Two stubbing operations are performed on the mock:
    - `when(sampleClass.getSample().isSth()).thenReturn(STUBBED_BOOLEAN_VALUE)`: This stubs the method `isSth()` of the object returned by `getSample()` to return a predefined boolean value (`STUBBED_BOOLEAN_VALUE`).
    - `when(sampleClass.getSample().getNumber()).thenReturn(STUBBED_INTEGER_VALUE)`: This stubs the method `getNumber()` of the object returned by `getSample()` to return a predefined integer value (`STUBBED_INTEGER_VALUE`).

- **Execution**:
  - The mock object `sampleClass` is serialized and deserialized using `SimpleSerializationUtil.serializeAndBack(sampleClass)`. This utility method is expected to handle the serialization and deserialization process, returning the deserialized object.

- **Assertions**:
  - The test first checks if the deserialized object `o` is an instance of `SampleClass`.
  - It then casts `o` to `SampleClass` and assigns it to `deserializedSample`.
  - The test asserts that the method `isSth()` on the object returned by `getSample()` of `deserializedSample` returns `STUBBED_BOOLEAN_VALUE`.
  - Similarly, it asserts that the method `getNumber()` on the object returned by `getSample()` of `deserializedSample` returns `STUBBED_INTEGER_VALUE`.

- **Error**:
  - The error occurs during the serialization and deserialization process, as indicated by the comment `// error occurred here`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the serialization utility method or the mock's configuration for serialization.

- **Test Utility Method**:
  - `SimpleSerializationUtil.serializeAndBack(sampleClass)`: Although the implementation is not provided, this method is expected to serialize the input object to a byte stream and then deserialize it back to an object. The error might be due to the mock not being properly serialized or deserialized, possibly because of missing configurations or unsupported features in the serialization process.
'''

In summary, the test is designed to ensure that a deeply stubbed and serializable mock can be serialized and deserialized while retaining its stubbed behavior. The failure suggests a problem in the serialization process, which could be due to the mock's configuration or the utility method's implementation."

### Analysis of the Test Failure

1. **Objective of the Test**:
   - The test aims to verify that a mock object created with deep stubs and marked as serializable can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining its behavior.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The stack trace indicates a `java.io.NotSerializableException` for `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.
   - This exception suggests that an object involved in the serialization process is not serializable.

3. **Test Setup**:
   - A mock of `SampleClass` is created with deep stubs and marked as serializable.
   - The mock is configured to return specific values for chained method calls.

4. **Serialization Process**:
   - The error occurs during the serialization and deserialization process, specifically when attempting to serialize the mock object.

### Common Patterns and Similarities

- The failure is related to the serialization of a mock object created with deep stubs.
- The `NotSerializableException` indicates that a component of the mock's configuration or its internal state is not serializable.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the serialization of the mock object with deep stubs:

1. **Non-Serializable Component**:
   - The `ReturnsDeepStubs` answer or one of its internal components (e.g., anonymous classes or lambda expressions) used in the mock configuration is not serializable. This is evident from the `NotSerializableException` for `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.

2. **Mockito Configuration**:
   - The deep stubbing mechanism in Mockito might be using internal classes or constructs that are not designed to be serializable. This could include anonymous inner classes or other constructs that do not implement `Serializable`.

### Recommendation

To address this issue, the production code should ensure that all components involved in the serialization of mocks with deep stubs are serializable. This may involve:

- **Reviewing Mockito's Deep Stubs Implementation**:
  - Ensure that all classes and constructs used in the deep stubbing process implement `Serializable`.
  - Consider refactoring any non-serializable components, such as anonymous inner classes, to be serializable.

- **Enhancing Serialization Support**:
  - If possible, modify the `ReturnsDeepStubs` implementation to ensure that it and its internal components are serializable.

By addressing these potential issues in the production code, the test should be able to serialize and deserialize the mock object successfully, maintaining its expected behavior."

### Analysis of the Test Failure

1. **Objective of the Test**:
   - The test aims to verify that a mock object created with deep stubs and marked as serializable can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining its behavior.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The stack trace indicates a `java.io.NotSerializableException` for `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.
   - This exception suggests that an object involved in the serialization process is not serializable.

3. **Test Setup**:
   - A mock of `SampleClass` is created with deep stubs and marked as serializable.
   - The mock is configured to return specific values for chained method calls.

4. **Serialization Process**:
   - The error occurs during the serialization and deserialization process, specifically when attempting to serialize the mock object.

### Common Patterns and Similarities

- The failure is related to the serialization of a mock object created with deep stubs.
- The `NotSerializableException` indicates that a component of the mock's configuration or its internal state is not serializable.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the serialization of the mock object with deep stubs:

1. **Non-Serializable Component**:
   - The `ReturnsDeepStubs` answer or one of its internal components (e.g., anonymous classes or lambda expressions) used in the mock configuration is not serializable. This is evident from the `NotSerializableException` for `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.

2. **Mockito Configuration**:
   - The deep stubbing mechanism in Mockito might be using internal classes or constructs that are not designed to be serializable. This could include anonymous inner classes or other constructs that do not implement `Serializable`.

### Recommendation

To address this issue, the production code should ensure that all components involved in the serialization of mocks with deep stubs are serializable. This may involve:

- **Reviewing Mockito's Deep Stubs Implementation**:
  - Ensure that all classes and constructs used in the deep stubbing process implement `Serializable`.
  - Consider refactoring any non-serializable components, such as anonymous inner classes, to be serializable.

- **Enhancing Serialization Support**:
  - If possible, modify the `ReturnsDeepStubs` implementation to ensure that it and its internal components are serializable.

By addressing these potential issues in the production code, the test should be able to serialize and deserialize the mock object successfully, maintaining its expected behavior."""

### Analysis of the Test Failure

1. **Objective of the Test**:
   - The test aims to verify that a mock object created with deep stubs and marked as serializable can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining its behavior.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The stack trace indicates a `java.io.NotSerializableException` for `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.
   - This exception suggests that an object involved in the serialization process is not serializable.

3. **Test Setup**:
   - A mock of `SampleClass` is created with deep stubs and marked as serializable.
   - The mock is configured to return specific values for chained method calls.

4. **Serialization Process**:
   - The error occurs during the serialization and deserialization process, specifically when attempting to serialize the mock object.

### Common Patterns and Similarities

- The failure is related to the serialization of a mock object created with deep stubs.
- The `NotSerializableException` indicates that a component of the mock's configuration or its internal state is not serializable.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the serialization of the mock object with deep stubs:

1. **Non-Serializable Component**:
   - The `ReturnsDeepStubs` answer or one of its internal components (e.g., anonymous classes or lambda expressions) used in the mock configuration is not serializable. This is evident from the `NotSerializableException` for `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.

2. **Mockito Configuration**:
   - The deep stubbing mechanism in Mockito might be using internal classes or constructs that are not designed to be serializable. This could include anonymous inner classes or other constructs that do not implement `Serializable`.

### Recommendation

To address this issue, the production code should ensure that all components involved in the serialization of mocks with deep stubs are serializable. This may involve:

- **Reviewing Mockito's Deep Stubs Implementation**:
  - Ensure that all classes and constructs used in the deep stubbing process implement `Serializable`.
  - Consider refactoring any non-serializable components, such as anonymous inner classes, to be serializable.

- **Enhancing Serialization Support**:
  - If possible, modify the `ReturnsDeepStubs` implementation to ensure that it and its internal components are serializable.

By addressing these potential issues in the production code, the test should be able to serialize and deserialize the mock object successfully, maintaining its expected behavior."""

### Analysis of the Test Failure

1. **Objective of the Test**:
   - The test aims to verify that a mock object created with deep stubs and marked as serializable can be serialized and deserialized correctly, maintaining its behavior.

2. **Error Details**:
   - The stack trace indicates a `java.io.NotSerializableException` for `org.mockito.internal.stubbing.defaultanswers.ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.
   - This exception suggests that an object involved in the serialization process is not serializable.

3. **Test Setup**:
   - A mock of `SampleClass` is created with deep stubs and marked as serializable.
   - The mock is configured to return specific values for chained method calls.

4. **Serialization Process**:
   - The error occurs during the serialization and deserialization process, specifically when attempting to serialize the mock object.

### Common Patterns and Similarities

- The failure is related to the serialization of a mock object created with deep stubs.
- The `NotSerializableException` indicates that a component of the mock's configuration or its internal state is not serializable.

### Possible Defect in Production Code

Given the analysis, the likely defect in the production code is related to the serialization of the mock object with deep stubs:

1. **Non-Serializable Component**:
   - The `ReturnsDeepStubs` answer or one of its internal components (e.g., anonymous classes or lambda expressions) used in the mock configuration is not serializable. This is evident from the `NotSerializableException` for `ReturnsDeepStubs$2`.

2. **Mockito Configuration**:
   - The deep stubbing mechanism in Mockito might be using internal classes or constructs that are not designed to be serializable. This could include anonymous inner classes or other constructs that do not implement `Serializable`.

### Recommendation

To address this issue, the production code should ensure that all components involved in the serialization of mocks with deep stubs are serializable. This may involve:

- **Reviewing Mockito's Deep Stubs Implementation**:
  - Ensure that all classes and constructs used in the deep stubbing process implement `Serializable`.
  - Consider refactoring any non-serializable components, such as anonymous inner classes, to be serializable.

- **Enhancing Serialization Support**:
  - If possible, modify the `ReturnsDeepStubs` implementation to ensure that it and its internal components are serializable.

By addressing these potential issues in the production code, the test should be able to serialize and deserialize the mock object successfully, maintaining its expected behavior."""
